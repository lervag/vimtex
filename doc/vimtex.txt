INTRODUCTION                                              *vimtex-introduction*

|vimtex| provides convenient functionality for editing LaTeX documents.  The
main goal of |vimtex| is to be simple, functional, and to be easy to customize
and evolve.

The documentation is understandably too long for a full read through. It is
recommended that new users read or skim the entire introduction, as it should
give a clear idea of what |vimtex| is and is not. The remaining part of the
documentation should then be considered a reference for the various parts of
the plugin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMENT ON INTERNAL TEX PLUGIN                        *vimtex-comment-internal*

Vim ships with some LaTeX support out of the box. In particular, it provides
good syntax highlighting (|ft-tex-syntax|), indentation (see the source file
$VIMRUNTIME/indent/tex.vim for the documentation), and some sensible options
(|ft-tex-plugin|).

When |vimtex| is active, it will be used as the main |ftplugin|. It will
define the same set of sensible settings as the internal plugin. However,
|vimtex| does not provide its own syntax, instead it adds a few minor
improvements to |ft-tex-syntax|, see |vimtex-syntax|. |vimtex| also provides its
own indentation plugin, see |vimtex-indent|.

Vim will generally autodetect filetypes automatically. In most cases this
works as expected, however, in some cases it will detect a file with the `tex`
suffix as a |plaintex|. To prevent this, one may set the option
|g:tex_flavor| in ones `vimrc` file, that is: >

  let g:tex_flavor = 'latex'

REQUIREMENTS                                              *vimtex-requirements*

The following is a list of specific requirements for running |vimtex| and some
of its key features.  There are a couple of relevant FAQs for those who use
|neovim| and those restricted to a Windows OS, see |vimtex-faq-neovim| and
|vimtex-faq-windows|.

Vim version~
                                                         *vimtex_version_check*
  |vimtex| supports Vim version 7.4.52 and neovim version 0.1.7.  It will not
  load for older versions, unless one adds >

    let g:vimtex_version_check = 0
<
  to one's `vimrc` file.  This might work, but issues due to older versions
  than the mentioned here will be ignored.

Compiler backend~

  |vimtex| uses `latexmk`, `latexrun`, `tectonic` or `arara` to compile the LaTeX document.

    `latexmk`: http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc
    "a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times to resolve
  cross references, etc; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex, makeindex if
  necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as requested).  It has a number of
  other useful capabilities, for example to start a previewer and then run
  latex whenever the source files are updated, so that the previewer gives an
  up-to-date view of the document. The script runs on both UNIX and MS-WINDOWS
  (XP, etc)." [Copied from the latexmk page.]  (|vimtex-latexmk|)

    `latexrun`: https://github.com/aclements/latexrun
    Similar to `latexmk` in that it runs the desired LaTeX engine an
  appropriate number of times, including `bibtex`/`biber`. However, it differs
  in philosophy in that it only does the build part. It does not support
  continuous builds, nor automatic starting of the viewer. However, it does
  parse the output log in order to provide a more concise list of relevant
  warnings and error messages (this has currently not been adapted to vimtex,
  as of yet). (|vimtex-latexrun|)

    `tectonic`: https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/
    `tectonic` is a complete, self-contained TeX/LaTeX engine, powered by XeTeX
  and TeXLive. It doesn't support continuous build like `latexmk` but it
  presents other worth mentioning features such as automatic support file
  downloading along with reproduceable builds and full Unicode and OpenType
  fonts support thanks to the power of XeTeX. (|vimtex-tectonic|)

    `arara`: https://github.com/cereda/arara
    `arara` is a TeX automation tool similar to the above mentioned tools,
  but where the compilation behaviour is typically defined in the preamble
  of the document. (|vimtex-arara|)

Job~
                                                          *vimtex-job*
  |vimtex| requires either |nvim|, Vim with |+job|, or |vimtex-clientserver| for the
  callback functionality to work. The callbacks are used to provide feedback
  when compilation is finished, as well as to parse the log for errors and
  warnings and to open the |quickfix| window when necessary.

Clientserver~
                                                          *vimtex-clientserver*
  |+clientserver| is necessary for backward search from PDF viewer to Vim.
  Further, when not on |nvim| or when |+job| is not available, then |vimtex|
  may use |+clientserver| for the callback functionality to work.

  A server will be started automatically if Vim is running on Windows, or if
  running in a GUI.  If you use Vim under a terminal in Linux or OSX, a server
  will not be started by default.  Since Vim version 8.0.475,
  |remote_startserver()| can be used to start a server from your `vimrc` file.
  The following will ensure Vim starts with a server, if it is possible from
  vimscript: >

    if empty(v:servername) && exists('*remote_startserver')
      call remote_startserver('VIM')
    endif
<
  Alternatively, Vim can be started with the command line option
  `--servername`, e.g. `vim --servername VIM` .  The simplest way to ensure
  this is to add an alias to your `.bashrc` (or similar), that is, add: >

    alias vim='vim --servername VIM'
<
  For other methods of ensuring that Vim is started with a servername, see:
  http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Enable_servername_capability_in_vim/xterm

  To test whether a server was successfully started, |serverlist()| can be
  used. E.g. `:echo serverlist()`

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FEATURES PROVIDED BY OTHER PLUGINS                        *vimtex-non-features*

The following is a list of features that one might think should be provided by
vimtex, but that are instead better provided by other plugins.

Linting and syntax checking~

  The following is a list of good plugins that have support for (La)TeX
  syntax checking.

    `ale`         https://github.com/w0rp/ale
    `neomake`     https://github.com/neomake/neomake
    `syntastic`   https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic

  All of the above plugins support `lacheck` [0], `chktex` [1], `proselint` [2].
  `neomake` also supports `rubberinfo` [3].

  [0]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/lacheck
  [1]: http://www.nongnu.org/chktex/
  [2]: http://proselint.com/
  [3]: https://www.systutorials.com/docs/linux/man/1-rubber-info/

Snippets/Templates~

  Snippets and/or templates are provided by for instance `neosnippet` and
  `UltiSnips`. See |vimtex-neosnippet| and |vimtex-UltiSnips| for more info.

Syntax highlighting~

  See |vimtex-comment-internal|.

Tag navigation~

  One may navigate by tags with the |CTRL-]| mapping, e.g. from
  `\eqref{eq:example}` to the corresponding `\label{eq:example}`. However,
  this requires that a tag file has been generated with |ctags|. I recommend
  that one uses the maintained version of ctags [0]. In addition,
  I recommend that one uses a plugin that automatically generates the tag
  files as necessary, e.g. |gutentags| [1].

  See |vimtex-faq-tags| and |vimtex-faq-tags-bibtex| for concrete examples.

  [0]: https://ctags.io/
  [1]: https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags

Manipulate surrounding commands/delimiters/environments~

  |vimtex| provides mappings that change, delete and toggle commands,
  delimiters and environments (see the `ds`, `cs` and `ts` family of
  mappings listed under |vimtex-default-mappings|).  These mappings are
  inspired by the great `surround.vim` [0] (|surround.txt|) by Tim Pope,
  which provides mappings to manipulate surrounding delimiters such as `''`,
  `""`, `()`, `[]`, `{}`, and `<>`.  As such, the mappings from vimtex
  should work well together with, and as an extension of, `surround.vim`.
  Consider also the customization described under |vimtex-faq-surround|.
  The mappings may be repeated with the dot (|.|) command. See also
  |g:vimtex_delim_list| if you are interested in customizing the delimiter
  pairs that are recognized.

  A different possibility is to use `vim-sandwich` [1] (|sandwich.txt|) by
  Machakann, which may be considered a generalisation of `surround.vim` in
  that it can handle much more complex sets of delimiters.  `vim-sandwich`
  is relatively easy to expand with custom surroundings and has built in
  support for LaTeX-specific surroundings such as quotations, ```text''`,
  and math delimiters, `$\left(a+b\right)$`.  For a list of supported
  delimiters, see |sandwich-filetype-recipes|.  `vim-sandwich` supports
  `vim-repeat` [2] in addition to `visualrepeat.vim` [3].

  Note: The default mappings of `vim-sandwich` differ from those of
    `surround.vim`, in that the use `s` as the prefix.  E.g., to add
    surroundings, one uses `sa{motion/textobject}{type-of-surrounding}`
    instead of `ys{motion/textobject}{type-of-surrounding}`.  If one prefers
    the map variants from `surround.vim`, these are also available as an
    option, see |sandwich-miscellaneous|.  And it is also easy to define
    custom mappings, if one prefers that.

  Note: `vim-sandwich` actually consists of three plugins that work
    together.  One should make sure to read the docs for all of them:
    |sandwich.txt|, |operator-sandwich.txt|, and |textobj-sandwich.txt|.

  [2]: https://github.com/tpope/vim-repeat
  [3]: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3848

Enhanced matching and higlighting of delimiters~

  |vimtex| highlights and allows navigation between matching pairs of
  delimiters including those in math mode, such as `\bigl(` and `\bigr)`, and
  the `\begin` and `\end` tags of environments. However, the implementation
  may be slow (see also |vimtex-faq-slow-matchparen|, and so one may use
  |g:vimtex_matchparen_enabled| to disable the highlighting).

  Alternatively, one may use the plugin |match-up| [0], which offers enhanced
  |matchparen| highlighting and `matchit.zip` style motions and |text-objects|
  for a variety of file types.  For LaTeX douments, it:
    - Extends highlighting and the `%` motion to a number of middle
      delimiters including
        - `\bigm` and `\middle` marked delimiters
        - `\item`s in `itemize` and `enumerate` environments
        - `\toprule`, `\midrule`, `\bottomrule` in the `tabular` environment.
        - `\if`, `\else` and `\endif`
      Note: |vimtex| does not support highlighting the middle delimiters.
    - Adds motions, `g%`, `[%`, and `]%` and text objects, `a%` and `i%` which move
      between matching delimiters and operate on delimited text.

  For example, with match-up enabled, >

    \left( \frac{a}{b} \middle| q \right)
<
  the motion `%` will cycle through `\left(`, `\middle|`, and `\right)`, whereas
  with vimtex only `\left(` and `\right)` will be matched.  The motion `g%`
  will do the same, except in reverse.

  To enable the plugin match-up after installation, add the following to
  your vimrc: >

    let g:matchup_override_vimtex = 1
<
  Matching may become computationally intensive for complex LaTeX documents.
  If you experience slowdowns while moving the cursor, the following option
  is recommended to delay highlighting slightly while navigating: >

    let g:matchup_matchparen_deferred = 1
<
  Note: The exact set of delimiters recognized may differ between match-up
    and vimtex.  For example, the mappings `da%` and `dad` will not in general
    be identical, particularly if you have customized vimtex's delimiters.

Formatting~

  vimtex has a custom |formatexpr| that may be enabled with the option
  |g:vimtex_format_enabled|. However, there are a lot of different styles for
  formatting LaTeX manuscripts. These are typically much more relevant when
  writing in collaboration with others. A good reference on this topic is [0],
  and note in particular the box "Directives for using LaTeX with version
  control systems".

  The most basic style is to hard wrap lines at a given column, e.g. 80
  columns, and this is exactly the type of formatting that is supported by
  vimtex. However, this is usually not very friendly when collaborating with
  others, as it tends to mess up diffs between versions of the document.
  Instead, one might want to consider one of these:

    a) keeping each sentence on a line (use soft wrapping)
    b) add additional indentation for split sentences [1]
    c) use semantic line feeds [2]

  In order to make it easier to use one of these styles of formatting, one may
  want to use an external formatter:

    - latexindent.pl [3]
    - vim-bucky [4] (note: this is an alpha version as of October 2018)

  Further, there are a range of Vim plugins that can be used to format your
  document with external tools. Some of these also allow autoformatting of
  some kind. In no particular order:

    - neoformat [5]
    - vim-codefmt [6]
    - vim-autoformat [7]
    - ale [8]
    - vim-sentence-chopper [9]

Filetype plugin for bib files~

  |vimtex| is not a filetype plugin for bibliography (`.bib`) files. However,
  it does include a couple of minor things, such as setting the 'comments' and
  'commentstring' options and a simple indentation expression, see
  |g:vimtex_indent_bib_enabled|.

  Here are a couple of other related Vim plugins and external tools that might
  be of interest:

  - `bibtool`
    An external tool for formatting, sorting, filtering, merging, and more of
    `.bib` files.
    http://www.gerd-neugebauer.de/software/TeX/BibTool/
  - `tbibtools`
    A set of ruby-based bibtex-related utilities for sorting, reformatting,
    listing contents, and so on. Has optional Vim integration.

  discussions.

SUPPORT FOR MULTI-FILE PROJECTS                             *vimtex-multi-file*

|vimtex| supports most multi-file documents.  The main method uses a recursive
search algorithm that should find the main LaTeX file in most cases.  For
special cases, there are several alternative methods for specifying the main
file.  These alternative methods all require some explicit declaration of the
main file.  Thus, these methods will be tried first, and the recursive search
is tried last if there are no explicit declarations that yield an appropriate
main LaTeX file candidate.

The methods are tried in the following order:

  1. Buffer variable
  2. TeX root directive
  3. Subfiles package
  4. File `.latexmain` specifier
  5. Recursive search

                                                                 *b:vimtex_main*
Buffer variable~
  The main file may be specified through the buffer variable `b:vimtex_main`.
  If one uses project specific |vimrc| files, one may then use an |autocmd| to
  specify the main file through this buffer variable with >

    autocmd BufReadPre *.tex let b:vimtex_main = 'main.tex'
<
                                                              *vimtex-tex-root*
TeX root directive~
  It is also possible to specify the main TeX file with a comment in one of
  the first five lines of the current file. Some examples: >

    %! TEX root = /path/to/my-main.tex
    %! TEX root = ../*.tex
    %! TEX root = **/main.tex
<
  Note: It is allowed to use a globbing pattern (see |wildcards|). If there
  are multiple matches, then vimtex will ask for input when the buffer is
  opened.

                                                               *vimtex-subfiles*
                                                                 *vimtex-import*
Subfiles package~
  |vimtex| also supports the `import` [0] and the `subfiles` [1] packages that
  can be used to make it easier to work with multi-file projects. If one uses
  the `subfiles` package, the |VimtexToggleMain| command is particularly
  useful.

  With `subfiles`, included files will look like this: >

    \documentclass[main.tex]{subfiles}
    \begin{document}
    ...
    \end{document}
<
  Absolute paths for to the main file (e.g. `main.tex`) will work as expected,
  but when using a relative path, one should note that vimtex assumes we start
  compilation from the directory of the main file. Thus one should not write
  e.g. `../main.tex`.

  [0]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/import
  [1]: https://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfiles

File .latexmain specifier~
  In some cases, it might be preferable to specify the main file by creating
  an indicator file.  The indicator file should be an empty file, and the name
  must be the name of the desired main file with `.latexmain` appended.  An
  example should make this clear: >

    path/file.tex
    path/file.tex.latexmain
    path/sections/file1.tex
    path/sections/file2.tex
<
  Here `path/file.tex.latexmain` indicates for `file1.tex` and `file2.tex`
  that `path/file.tex` is the main LaTeX file.

Recursive search~
  If no other method provides an appropriate candidate, then the recursive
  search detects the main LaTeX file by searching for a file in the current
  and parent directories that includes the present file and has the
  `\documentclass` line.

  This should work in most cases, but it may fail if for instance the project
  structure is something like this: >

    path1/main.tex
    path2/chapter.tex
<
  That is, the main file detection will not work for the file `chapter.tex`,
  because the main file does not live in the same folder or a parent folder.
  In this particular case, the TeX root directive should work.

  Note: In rare cases, such as if there are _very_ many tex files in the
        directory tree, this method may be slow. One may therefore disable it
        through the option |g:vimtex_disable_recursive_main_file_detection|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUPPORT FOR TEX DIRECTIVES                              *vimtex-tex-directives*

|vimtex| supports two of the commonly used TeX directives [0]: the TeX root and
the TeX program directive. The TeX root directive was already described above,
see |vimtex-tex-root|.

                                                           *vimtex-tex-program*
The TeX program directive works by specifying the TeX compiler program in
a comment in one of the first lines of the main project file. It is parsed
during initialization, but if desired one may manually reload vimtex in order
to reset the program during an editing session. See |VimtexReload| and
|<plug>(vimtex-reload)| (by default mapped to `<localleader>lx`).

The syntax is best explained with an example: >

    %! TEX program = program

Here `program` corresponds to a key in the |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk_engines|
or |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun_engines| dictionaries. See also [0,1].

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PACKAGE DETECTION                                    *vimtex-package-detection*

vimtex maintains a list of latex packages that are required by the current
project. This list is used by vimtex for instance to determine which commands
to suggest during command completion (see |vimtex-complete-commands|) and
which packages to look up documentation for (see |vimtex-doc-package|). The
list can be viewed with |:VimtexInfo|.

The package list is determined in two ways: >

1. If a `.fls` file exists having the name of the main file, it is scanned.
   This file is created by the tex program (e.g., pdflatex) during compilation
   and might not be supported by all tex programs. Parsing the `.fls` file is
   done both at vimtex initialization and after each successful compilation,
   if possible.

   Note: Parsing after successful compilations requires that one uses
         a) continuous compilation with callbacks (see the `callback` option
            for |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk|), or
         b) single-shot compilation with the `jobs` or `nvim` backend (see the
            `backend` option of |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| and
            |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun|). If one uses the `process` backend
            (e.g. on older Vim versions), one must either have the `callback`
            option also enabled or it must run in foreground.

2. Otherwise, the preamble is parsed for `\usepackage` statements. This is
   slower and less accurate than `.fls` file parsing. Therefore, it is only
   done during vimtex initialization. If desired, one may manually reload
   vimtex to parse the preamble again during an editing session. See
   |VimtexReload| and |<plug>(vimtex-reload)| (by default mapped to
   `<localleader>lx`).

USAGE                                                            *vimtex-usage*

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEFAULT MAPPINGS                                      *vimtex-default-mappings*

|vimtex| is designed to be controlled by a selection of mappings.  Note,
though, that most of the mappings are also available as commands, see
|vimtex-commands|.

Many of the mappings utilize the |maplocalleader|. The right-hand sides are
provided as <plug>-mappings, see |using-<plug>|. For any given <plug> map, the
default mapping will only be created if it does not already exist. This means
that if a user defines a custom mapping, e.g. with >

  nmap <space>li <plug>(vimtex-info)

then the corresponding default left-hand side will not be mapped.

If one prefers, one may disable all the default mappings through the option
|g:vimtex_mappings_enabled|.  Custom mappings for all desired features must
then be defined through the listed RHS <plug>-maps or by mapping the available
commands.

In the below list of mappings, LHS is the default mapping, RHS is the
corresponding <plug>-maps, and MODE indicates in which vim mode the mappings
are valid.

In addition to the mappings listed below, |vimtex| provides convenient insert
mode mappings to make it easier and faster to type mathematical equations.
This feature is explained in more detail later, see |vimtex-imaps|.

OPTIONS                                                        *vimtex-options*

*g:vimtex_enabled*
  Set to 0 to disable |vimtex|.

  Default value: Undefined.

*g:vimtex_compiler_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable the `compiler` interface, see |vimtex-compiler|.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_compiler_progname*
  Path to vim executable.  This is used for the callback functionality, and it
  must be set correctly in order for the callback function to work.  The
  default value should work correctly in most cases, but in some cases, e.g.
  for MacVim, one might need to set it manually to get the callbacks to work
  as expected.

  Default value: |v:progpath| if it exists, else |v:progname|.

*g:vimtex_compiler_callback_hooks*
  A list of functions that will be called from the vimtex compiler callback.
  The compilation status must be taken as an argument. This allows users to
  add custom callback functionality.

  Note: The Zathura and MuPDF viewers, if used, add a hook to this list in
        order to store the viewer X window ID in order to prevent multiple
        viewer windows.

  Example: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_callback_hooks = ['MyTestHook']

    function! MyTestHook(status)
      echom a:status
    endfunction

<  Default value: []

*g:vimtex_compiler_method*
  Set the compiler method. Available choices are:

    latexmk~
      See |vimtex-latexmk| for more details, and |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk|
      for customization.

    latexrun~
      See |vimtex-latexrun| for more details, and |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun|
      for customization.

    tectonic~
      See |vimtex-tectonic| for more details, and |g:vimtex_compiler_tectonic|
      for customization.

    arara~
      See |vimtex-arara| for more details, and |g:vimtex_compiler_arara| for
      customization.

  Default value: 'latexmk'

*g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk*
  This is a dictionary that allows customization of the |vimtex-latexmk|
  compiler. The values set by the user will take precedence over the default
  values.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk = {
        \ 'backend' : DEPENDS ON SYSTEM (SEE BELOW),
        \ 'background' : 1,
        \ 'build_dir' : '',
        \ 'callback' : 1,
        \ 'continuous' : 1,
        \ 'executable' : 'latexmk',

        \   '-interaction=nonstopmode',
        \ ],
        \}
<
  The default value shows which entries may be changed. Here the different
  keys are explained in more detail:

  backend~
    Sets the backend for running processes. Possible values are:

      `process`  Traditional interface that should work (tm) on all systems.
               It uses |!:| to control the compiler processes.
      `jobs`     Uses |job| to control the processes. This is available on
               modern Vim installations. Note that this will start every job
               in the background, regardless of the value of the `background`
               key. The output may be viewed through |VimtexCompileOutput|.
      `nvim`     This uses the neovim |job-control| system to control the
               compiler process. It is very similar to the `jobs` backend.

    The default value is to use the `jobs` or `nvim` backend, if supported,
    and fallback to `process` if not.

  background~
    This option sets whether single shot compilations should be run in the
    foreground or the background. Note that it is only relevant for the
    `process` backend.

  build_dir~
    This option sets the compilation build directory.  It corresponds to the
    `-output-directory` option in `latexmk`.  If the path is a relative path,
    then it will be considered relative to the main project file.

    Note 1: This option only works with `latexmk` version 4.27 and later.
    Note 2: If `$out_dir` is added to `.latexmkrc`, then the `.latexmkrc` setting
            will have priority.

  callback~
    If enabled, this option tells `latexmk` to run |vimtex#compiler#callback|
    after compilation is finished.

    Note 1: This feature requires |nvim|, Vim with |+job| or |+clientserver|.
    Note 2: When using |clientserver|, the callback is run with the vim
            executable defined by |g:vimtex_compiler_progname|.
    Note 3: Callbacks are only possible when the `backend` is one of `nvim` or
            `jobs`, or when `continuous` is also activated.

  continuous~
    If enabled, `latexmk` will run in continuous mode, i.e. with the `-pvc`
    argument. This means that the document is compiled automatically by
    `latexmk` every time a related file has been changed, until the processes
    is stopped.

    If disabled, `latexmk` will run single shot compilations.

    Note: The events |VimtexEventCompileStarted| and |VimtexEventCompileStopped|
          are only relevant when this option is enabled.

  executable~
    The name/path to the `latexmk` executable.

  hooks~
    A list of |Funcref|s. If running in continuous mode, each hook will be
    called for each line of output from `latexmk`, with that line as argument.
    E.g., to show information about the compilation run numbers, one could do
    this: >

      function! Callback(msg)
        let l:m = matchlist(a:msg, '\vRun number (\d+) of rule ''(.*)''')
        if !empty(l:m)
          echomsg l:m[2] . ' (' . l:m[1] . ')'
        endif
      endfunction
      let g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk = { 'hooks': [function('Callback')] }
<
  options~
    This is a list of options that are passed to `latexmk`. The default
    options should work well for most people.

    Note: By default, the option `-pdf` is also supplied to indicate the LaTeX
          engine. This may be changed on a per project basis with TeX
          directives, see |vimtex-tex-program| or the two compiler-specific
          options
            |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk_engines|
            and |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun_engines|.
          The latter two options may also be used to change the default engine.

    Note: Options may also be specified indirectly to `latexmk` through both
          a global and a project specific `.latexmkrc` file. One should know,
          though, that options specified on the command line has priority, and
          so if one wants to override one of the above default options, then
          one has to set this key to a list that contains the desired options.

*g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk_engines*
  Defines a map between TeX program directive (|vimtex-tex-program|) and
  compiler engine. This is used by |vimtex-latexmk| to define the LaTeX
  program. The `_` key defines the default engine.

  Note: If the TeX program directive is not specified within the main project
        file, and if `$pdf_mode` is added to a project-specific `.latexmkrc`
        file, then the compiler engine will be deduced from the value of
        `$pdf_mode`. The supported values of `$pdf_mode` are 0 (pdflatex), 4
        (lualatex) and 5 (xelatex). See the latexmk documentation for details.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk_engines = {
        \ '_'                : '-pdf',
        \ 'pdflatex'         : '-pdf',
        \ 'dvipdfex'         : '-pdfdvi',
        \ 'lualatex'         : '-lualatex',
        \ 'xelatex'          : '-xelatex',
        \ 'context (pdftex)' : '-pdf -pdflatex=texexec',
        \ 'context (luatex)' : '-pdf -pdflatex=context',
        \ 'context (xetex)'  : '-pdf -pdflatex=''texexec --xtx''',
        \}

*g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun*
  This is a dictionary that allows customization of the |vimtex-latexrun|
  compiler. The values set by the user will take precedense over the default
  values.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun = {
        \ 'backend' : DEPENDS ON SYSTEM (SEE BELOW),
        \ 'background' : 1,
        \ 'build_dir' : '',
        \ 'options' : [
        \   '-verbose-cmds',
        \   '--latex-args="-synctex=1"',
        \ ],
        \}
<
  The default value shows which entries may be changed. Here the different
  keys are explained in more detail:

  backend~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `backend`.

  background~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `background`.

  build_dir~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `build_dir`.

  options~
    This is a list of options that are passed to `latexrun`. The default
    options should work well for most people.

    Note: By default, the option `-pdf` is also supplied to indicate the LaTeX
          engine. This may be changed on a per project basis with TeX
          directives, see |vimtex-tex-program| or the two compiler-specific
          options
            |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk_engines|
            and |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun_engines|.
          The latter two options may also be used to change the default engine.

*g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun_engines*
  Defines a map between TeX program directive (|vimtex-tex-program|) and
  compiler engine, i.e. as should be specified to the `--latex-cmd` argument
  to `latexrun`. This is used by |vimtex-latexrun| to define the LaTeX
  program. The `_` key defines the default engine.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun_engines = {
        \ '_'                : 'pdflatex',
        \ 'pdflatex'         : 'pdflatex',
        \ 'lualatex'         : 'lualatex',
        \ 'xelatex'          : 'xelatex',
        \}

*g:vimtex_compiler_tectonic*
  This is a dictionary that allows customization of the |vimtex-tectonic|
  compiler. The values set by the user will take precedense over the default
  values.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_tectonic = {
        \ 'backend' : DEPENDS ON SYSTEM (SEE BELOW),
        \ 'background' : 1,
        \ 'build_dir' : '',
        \ 'options' : [
        \   '--keep-logs',
        \   '--synctex'
        \ ],
        \}
<
  The default value shows which entries may be changed. Here the different
  keys are explained in more detail:

  backend~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `backend`.

  background~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `background`.

  build_dir~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `build_dir`. This will be created if
    needed, since tectonic won't build anything unless it exists.

  options~
    This is a list of options that are passed to `tectonic`. The default
    options should work well for most people. For anyone who wishes to modify
    these, please note:
    - Don't use `--outdir` or `-o` here. Use the `build_dir` option instead.
    - Without `--keep-logs` (or `--keep-intermediates` or `-k)`, you won't see
      errors/warnings in the quickfix list when compilations finish.
    - By default, `tectonic` cleans all auxiliary files (such as `.aux`,
      `.toc`, etc.). If you omit the `--keep-logs` (or similar) options that
      specify to keep these files, |VimtexClean| and |<plug>(vimtex-clean)|
      won't delete anything (as there is nothing to delete).

*g:vimtex_compiler_arara*
  This is a dictionary that allows customization of the |vimtex-arara|
  compiler. The values set by the user will take precedense over the default
  values.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_compiler_arara = {
        \ 'backend' : DEPENDS ON SYSTEM (SEE BELOW),
        \ 'background' : 1,
        \ 'options' : ['-v'],
        \}
<
  The default value shows which entries may be changed. Here the different
  keys are explained in more detail:

  backend~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `backend`.

  background~
    Same as |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| / `background`.

  options~
    This is a list of options that are passed to `arara`. The default options
    should work well for most people.

*g:vimtex_complete_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable |vimtex| completion.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_complete_smart_case*
  If enabled, then vimtex will filter case sensitive if there is a capital
  letter in the completion input. This is only relevant if
  |g:vimtex_complete_ignore_case| is also enabled.

  Default value: Same as your 'smartcase' value

*g:vimtex_complete_ignore_case*
  If enabled, then vimtex will filter case insensitive.

  Default value: Same as your 'ignorecase' value

*g:vimtex_complete_close_braces*
  This option controls whether to append a closing brace after a label or
  a citation has been completed.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_parser_bib_backend*
  This option sets the desired default backend for parsing bibliographies.
  This is used e.g. for gathering completion candidates. Possible values:

    `bibtex`:   The fastest, but most hacky solution. Should work well in most
              cases.

    `bibparse`: Also fast, but might be more robust.

    `vim`:      The slowest but perhaps most robust solution, as it does not
              require any external utilities.

  Default value: `bibtex`

*g:vimtex_complete_bib*
  This option is a dictionary for controlling the citation completion. The
  keys each control a different thing:

  simple~
    Default value: 0
    If nonzero, then cite completion only searches on the bib keys. This may
    work better e.g. if one uses an autocomplete plugin.

                                               *g:vimtex_complete_bib.menu_fmt*
  menu_fmt~
    Default value: `'[@type] @author_short (@year), "@title"'`
    The format used for the `menu` entry for bib completion candidates (see
    |complete-items|). The following keys may be used to define the string:

      @key           The bibtex key
      @title         Title
      @year          Publication year
      @author_all    Full author list
      @author_short  Shortened author list
      @type          Type of entry

    If the key is set to an empty string, then the `menu` entry is not added
    to the completion canidates.

  abbr_fmt~
    Default value: `''`
    The format used for the `abbr` entry for bib completion candidates. See
    `menu_fmt` for further description.

  custom_patterns~
    Default value: []
    List of custom trigger patterns that may be used to allow completion for
    e.g. custom macros.

  If one wants to overwrite one of the keys, e.g. the `simple` entry, one can do: >

    let g:vimtex_complete_bib = { 'simple': 1 }
<
  This does not modify the other keys and their default values.

*g:vimtex_complete_ref*
  This option is a dictionary for controlling the label completion. The
  keys each control a different thing:

  custom_patterns~
    Default value: []
    List of custom trigger patterns that may be used to allow completion for
    e.g. custom macros.

  For example, if one has defined the command `\figref`, one could add following
  custom pattern >

     let g:vimtex_complete_ref = {
        \ 'custom_patterns' = ['\\figref\*\?{[^}]*$']
        \ }

*g:vimtex_delim_list*
  A dictionary that defines the pairs of delimiters that are recognized by
  |vimtex| for various commands and functions. The dictionary contains 5 sub
  dictionaries:

    `env_tex`     Pairs of environment delimiters in normal TeX mode
    `env_math`    Pairs of special math environment delimiters
    `delim_tex`   Pairs of delimiters in normal TeX mode
    `delim_math`  Pairs of delimiters in math mode
    `mods`        Pairs of modifiers for math mode delimiters

  Each entry is a dictionary with the following format: >

    {
    \ 'name' : [
    \   ['\(', '\)'],
    \   ['\[', '\]'],
    \   ['$$', '$$'],
    \   ['$', '$'],
    \ ],
    \ 're' : [
    \   ['\\(', '\\)'],
    \   ['\\\@<!\\\[', '\\\]'],
    \   ['\$\$', '\$\$'],
    \   ['\$', '\$'],
    \ ],
    \}
<
  Here the `name` entry is a list of delimiter pairs as they are typed, and the
  `re` entry is a corresponding list of regexes that matches the delimiters.

  The default value should generally suffice for most people. If one wants to
  overwrite one of the main entries, e.g. the `mods` entry, one can do: >

    let g:vimtex_delim_list = {
          \ 'mods' : {
          \   'name' : [ ... ],
          \ }
          \}
<
  Here the `re` entry was not provided, in which case it will be automatically
  generated based on the `name` entry. The remaining four entries will remain
  the default value.

  Some people may be interested in adding support for e.g. german or french
  quotation marks. These may be added by extending the default `delim_tex`
  entries, like this: >

    let g:vimtex_delim_list = {
        \ 'delim_tex' : {
        \   'name' : [
        \     ['[', ']'],
        \     ['{', '}'],
        \     ['\glq', '\grq'],
        \     ['\glqq', '\grqq'],
        \     ['\flq', '\frq'],
        \     ['\flqq', '\frqq'],
        \    ]
        \  }
        \}
<
                                                         *g:vimtex#delim#lists*
                                                         *g:vimtex#delim#re*
  Note: This option is parsed on plugin initialization into a new variable,
        |g:vimtex#delim#lists| where the `re` entries are added and that also
        contains some combinations such as `tex_all`, `delim_all`, and `all`.
        Further, the option is also used as a basis for the variable
        |g:vimtex#delim#re|, which contains full regexes for matching opening
        and/or closing delimiters of the desired type.

  Default value: See `s:init_delim_lists()` in `autoload/vimtex/delim.vim`.

*g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list*
  Defines a list of delimiter modifiers to toggle through using the maps:

    |<plug>(vimtex-delim-toggle-modifier)|
    |<plug>(vimtex-delim-toggle-modifier-reverse)|

  The list must be a subset of the `mods` entry of |g:vimtex_delim_list|,
  otherwise the toggle will not work properly.  Thus, if one wants to toggle
  non-standard delimiters, then one must also update the above option.

  Example 1: to toggle between no modifiers, the `\left/\right` pair, and the
  `\mleft/\mright` pair, one may use the following options: >

    let g:vimtex_delim_list = {'mods' : {}}
    let g:vimtex_delim_list.mods.name = [
          \ ['\left', '\right'],
          \ ['\mleft', '\mright'],
          \ ['\bigl', '\bigr'],
          \ ['\Bigl', '\Bigr'],
          \ ['\biggl', '\biggr'],
          \ ['\Biggl', '\Biggr'],
          \ ['\big', '\big'],
          \ ['\Big', '\Big'],
          \ ['\bigg', '\bigg'],
          \ ['\Bigg', '\Bigg'],
          \]
    let g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list = [
      \ ['\left', '\right'],
      \ ['\mleft', '\mright'],
      \]
<
  Example 2: to step through no modifiers, and the pairs `\bigl/\bigr`,
  `\Bigl/\Bigr`, `\biggl/\biggr`, and `\Biggl/\Biggr`, one may use: >

    let g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list = [
      \ ['\bigl', '\bigr'],
      \ ['\Bigl', '\Bigr'],
      \ ['\biggl', '\biggr'],
      \ ['\Biggl', '\Biggr'],
      \]
<
  Default value: `[['\left', '\right']]`

*g:vimtex_delim_timeout*
*g:vimtex_delim_insert_timeout*
  Timeout when searching for matching delimiters. It is used for the {timeout}
  argument of |search()|-like function calls. If the option is increased it
  will make the matching more accurate, at the expense of potential lags. The
  default value should work well for most people.

  Default values: 300, 60 (respectively)

*g:vimtex_delim_stopline*
  A tolerance for the number of lines to search for matching delimiters in
  each direction. It is used in an expression for the {stopline} argument of
  |search()| function calls. If the option is increased it will make the
  matching more accurate, at the expense of potential lags. The default value
  should work well for most people.

  Default value: 500

*g:vimtex_disable_recursive_main_file_detection*
  In rare cases, the recursive method of finding the main file in multi file
  projects may be slow. This might happen for instance when there are _very_
  many tex files in the directory tree that is searched. In such cases, one
  may disable the recursive method by setting this variable to a nonzero
  value.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_doc_handlers*
  By default, package documentation is looked up online through
  http://texdoc.net/pkg/packagename. With this option, one may specify a list
  of custom handlers. A handler is a function that takes a single |Dict|
  argument with the following keys:

    type~
      One of `documentclass`, `usepackage`, `command` or `word`.

    candidates~
      A list of detected packages (for the types `command` and `usepackage`,
      this list may be larger than 1.

    selected~
      The currently selected entry. This is the package name that will
      ultimately be passed to the lookup function.

    name~
      If the type is `command`, this is the name of the command. Else it is
      not defined.

  Each handler in the list will be tried until a handler provides a return
  value of 1. One may add handlers that only makes minor modifications of the
  context and passes it on to the default handler, as well as handlers that
  fully completes the lookup e.g. through a local lookup with `texdoc`.

  Note that the context may have multiple candidates, and that the handlers
  are applied before any internal selection is made. Thus the `selected` key
  may not defined. This allows the handler to perform the selection itself, or
  one may manually call the selection function `vimtex#doc#make_selection` to
  get a simple selection menu.

  The following example uses the local `texdoc` to open the documentation: >

    let g:vimtex_doc_handlers = ['MyHandler']
    function! MyHandler(context)
      call vimtex#doc#make_selection(a:context)
      if !empty(a:context.selected)
        execute '!texdoc' a:context.selected '&'
      endif
      return 1
    endfunction
<
  Default value: []

*g:vimtex_echo_verbose_input*
  For the set of operator mappings that change a surrounding type [0],
  |vimtex| by default prints some information about what you are doing while
  waiting for user input. For advanced/experienced users, one will not need
  this info and can get a slightly clearner UI by disabling this feature (set
  the option 0).

  Default value: 1

  [0]: This affects the following mappings:
    |<plug>(vimtex-env-change)|        (default map: `cse`)
    |<plug>(vimtex-env-change-math)|   (default map: `cs$`)
    |<plug>(vimtex-cmd-change)|        (default map: `csc`)
    |<plug>(vimtex-delim-change-math)| (default map: `csd`)

*g:vimtex_env_change_autofill*
  If enabled, the current environment value is used as a default input for
  |<plug>(vimtex-env-change)| and |<plug>(vimtex-env-change-math)|. Some users
  may find this useful in order to quickly change from things like `align` to
  `aligned`.

  Note: If enabled, one may erase the autofilled content with |c_CTRL-U| (i.e.
        `<c-u>`).

  Default: 0

*g:vimtex_fold_enabled*
  Use this option to enable folding. More detailed info can be found in the
  section |vimtex-folding|.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_fold_manual*
  With this option enabled, |vimtex| uses |fold-manual| as the main
  |foldmethod|.  It still uses the |foldexpr| function to compute the fold
  levels, but it only computes the fold levels on demand, see
  |VimtexRefreshFolds| and |vimtex-zx|.

  The reasoning behind this option is that the |fold-expr| method of folding
  may sometimes be slow, e.g. for long lines and large files. |fold-manual| is
  very fast.

  An alternative to this method of speeding up is to use a dedicated plugin
  for optimizing the fold functionality, see e.g.
  https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_fold_levelmarker*

  Use custom section symbol for folding.

  Default value: '*'

*g:vimtex_fold_types*
*g:vimtex_fold_types_defaults*
  This is a dictionary where each key configures the corresponding fold type.
  One may disable the fold types by setting the key `enabled` to 0. If a type
  can be configured with a list of patterns or similar, the patterns assume
  that one uses very magic regexes (see |\v|).

  Each entry in |g:vimtex_fold_types| is combined with the corresponding entry
  of |g:vimtex_fold_types_defaults|. If there are conflicting entries, then
  |g:vimtex_fold_types| take presedence. This way, it is easy to customize
  various fold types without touching those that can stay with default
  configuration.

  The available fold types (and keys) are listed below, and the default
  configurations are listed at the bottom.

    <preamble>          Fold the preamble.

    <sections>          Fold sections and parts of documents. Can be
                        configured with the following extra keys:
                        - `parse_levels`: Whether to use detailed parsing to
                                        set fold text levels similar to how
                                        they are displayed in |vimtex-toc|.
                                        Disabled by default, because it uses
                                        more resources and may be slow.
                        - `sections`:     List of sections that should be folded.
                        - `parts`:        List of parts that should be folded.

                        When a LaTeX document is opened, the document is
                        parsed in order to define the highest fold level based
                        on which parts (such as frontmatter, backmatter, and
                        appendix) and section types (parts, chapter, section,
                        etc.) are present. This parsing is done automatically
                        every time the folds are recomputed, if there are any
                        changes to the file.

                        The fold function also recognizes "fake" sections.
                        That is, it parses comments similar to: >

                          % Fakepart title
                          % Fakechapter title
                          % Fakesection title
                          % Fakesubsection title
<
                        The fake sections are folded at the same level as the
                        corresponding "real" sections. The fold title is the
                        provided title with the `Fake...` part prepended.

    <comments>          Fold multiline comments. This is disabled by default.

    <markers>           Fold on vim-style markers inside comments, that is,
                        pairs of e.g. `{{{` and `}}}` (the default markers).
                        |regex| patterns for the opening and closing markers
                        may be customized with the keys:
                        - `open`
                        - `close`

                        Note: Patterns are only searched inside comments!

    <envs>              Fold environments.
                        Can be further configured with a blacklist and
                        whitelist of environments to be folded.

                        Note: The `document` environment will never be folded.

    <env_options>       This fold type allows to fold the `\begin` command if
                        it contains a long optional argument. Consider the
                        following example: >

                          \begin{axis}[    --->    \begin{axis}[...]
                              width=6cm,
                              height=8cm,
                              ...,
                          ]
<
                        Here the `axis` environment must not be otherwise
                        folded through the <envs> fold type.

    <cmd_single>        Fold long commands with a single argument. E.g.: >

                          \hypersetup{    --->    \hypersetup{...}
                            option 1,
                            ...,
                            option n
                            }
<
    <cmd_single_opt>    Fold commands that opens with a single long optional
                        argument that is followed by a short "real" argument.
                        E.g.: >

                          \usepackage[    --->    \usepackage[...]{name}
                            option 1,
                            ...,
                            option n
                            ]{name}
<
    <cmd_multi>         Fold commands that start with a short regular argument
                        and continue with long optional and/or regular
                        arguments. E.g.: >

                          \newcommand{\xx}[3]{    --->    \newcommand{\xx} ...
                            Hello #1, #2, and #3.
                          }
<
    <cmd_addplot>       Folding of the `\addplot` series of commands from the
                        `pgfplots` package. E.g.: >

                          \addplot+[] table[] {    --->    \addplot+[] table[] {...};
                            table data
                          };
<
  As an example, the following configuration will disable folding of the
  preamble, as well as the `figure` and `table` environments. >

*g:vimtex_format_enabled*
  If enabled, |vimtex| uses a custom |formatexpr| that should handle inline
  comments and environments. That is, if it is enabled, comments at end of
  lines will not be joined with the |gq| command, and environments like
  `equation` will not be joined/changed.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_imaps_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable the insert mode mappings.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_imaps_leader*
  The default leader key for insert mode mappings.

  Default value: '`'

*g:vimtex_imaps_disabled*
  A list of mappings to disable. That is, any left-hand side that matches
  a string in this list will not be mapped to its corresponding right-hand
  side. This may be used to selectively disable one or more from the default
  list of mappings.

  Default value: []

*g:vimtex_imaps_list*
  The list of mappings to generate on start up. The list of activated mappings
  can be viewed with |VimtexImapsList|.

  Default value: See `autoload/vimtex.vim` (it's a long list)

*g:vimtex_include_indicators*
  Vimtex will recognize included files for a lot of different purposes. Most
  of these come from e.g. `\input{file}` or `\include{file}`. This option
  allows to add more commands that are used to include files.

  Note: This option is read during initialization of vimtex, and so it must be
        set early. I.e., it can not be set in `after/ftplugin/tex.vim`.

  Default value: ['input', 'include', 'subfile']

*g:vimtex_include_search_enabled*
  Vimtex sets 'includeexpr' to recognize included files. If a file isn't found
  in the current directory, Vimtex uses `kpsewhich` to search for it in the
  system TeX distribution. If the 'complete' option includes "i", invoking
  keyword completion with |i_CTRL-N| will search included files for completion
  possibilities. In this case, there may be a lot of calls to `kpsewhich`
  while scanning for included files during the first invocation of keyword
  completion, and this may introduce a significant delay. Subsequent keyword
  completions should be faster, as the calls to `kpsewhich` are cached.

  This option allows to disable searching for included files with `kpsewhich`,
  and with that prevent the above explained delay.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_indent_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable |vimtex| indentation.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_indent_bib_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable |vimtex| indentation of bibliography files.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_indent_conditionals*
  This is a dictionary that defines regexes for indenting conditionals. Set it
  to an empty dictionary to disable this type of indentation.

  Default value: >
    let g:vimtex_indent_conditionals = {
          \ 'open': '\v%(\\newif)@<!\\if%(field|name|numequal|thenelse)@!',
          \ 'else': '\\else\>',
          \ 'close': '\\fi\>',
          \}

*g:vimtex_indent_delims*
  A dictionary that specifies how to indent delimiters. The dictionary has
  four keys:

    open~
      List of regexes for opening delimiters that should add indents.

    close~
      List of regexes for closing delimiters that should reduce indents.

    close_indented~
      Set this to 1 if you want the line with the closing delimiter to stay
      indented.

    include_modified_math~
      Set this to 0 if you do not want modified math delimiters such as
      `\left(` and `\right)` to add/reduce indents.

  Note: Vimtex does not allow indents for parantheses only in math mode or any
        similar kind of context aware delimiter indents.

  Note: If one of the keys of the dictionary is not specified, the default
        value is assumed.

  Default value: >
    let g:vimtex_indent_delims = {
          \ 'open' : ['{'],
          \ 'close' : ['}'],
          \ 'close_indented' : 0,
          \ 'include_modified_math' : 1,
          \}

*g:vimtex_indent_ignored_envs*
  List of environments that should not add/reduce indentation.

  Default value: ['document']

*g:vimtex_indent_lists*
  List of environments that act like lists with `\item` entries.

  Default value: [
      \ 'itemize',
      \ 'description',
      \ 'enumerate',
      \ 'thebibliography',
      \]

*g:vimtex_indent_on_ampersands*
  By default, vimtex will align on `leading` ampersands e.g. in math aligned
  environments or in tabular environments. If this feature is not wanted it
  may be disabled through this option.

  Note: To get a more advanced tabular like alignment feature, you may be
        interested in something like |vim-easy-align|:
        https://github.com/junegunn/vim-easy-align

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_mappings_enabled*
  Control whether or not to load the default mappings.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_mappings_disable*
  A dictionary that can be used to disable specific mappings.  The dictionary
  keys are the mapping modes, and the values are lists of default mappings
  that should be disabled.  The following example will ensure that the default
  `tse` and `tsd` mappings are disabled: >

    let g:vimtex_mappings_disable = {
        \ 'n': ['tse', 'tsd'],
        \ 'x': ['tsd'],
        \}
<
  Default value: {}

*g:vimtex_matchparen_enabled*
  Enable highlighting of matching delimiters.

  Note: This is an improved version of |matchparen|. It should be possible to
        keep |matchparen| activated, which matches delimiters listed in
        'matchpairs'. The |vimtex| specific version will also match LaTeX
        specific delimiters, which is not possible with |matchparen|.

  Note: If you think this feature is slow, see |vimtex-faq-slow-matchparen|.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_motion_enabled*
  This option enables the motion mappings `%`, `[[`, `[]`, `][`, and `]]`. It
  also enables the highlighting of matching delimiters.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_log_ignore*
  A list of regexes to filter info, warning, and error messages. If a logged
  message matches any of the regexes in this list, the message will not be
  printed to screen.

  Note: All messages may still be viewed with |VimtexLog|.

  Default: []

*g:vimtex_log_verbose*
  Whether or not to print messages to screen. Should generally be on, but may
  be turned off e.g. for debugging or testing purposes.

  Default: 1

*g:vimtex_quickfix_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable the quickfix integration.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_quickfix_method*
  This option sets the quickfix method. The following methods are available:

  latexlog~
    This is the standard method which parses the normal LaTeX output. See
    |g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog| for configuration.

  pplatex~
    Uses `pplatex` (https://github.com/stefanhepp/pplatex) to parse the LaTeX
    output file. `pplatex` is a command line utility used to pretify the
    output of the LaTeX compiler.

  pulp~
    Uses `pulp` (https://github.com/dmwit/pulp) to parse the LaTeX output
    file, similar to `pplatex`.

  Note: `pplatex` and `pulp` require that `-file-line-error` is NOT passed to the LaTeX
  compiler. |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| will be updated automatically if one
  uses `latexmk` through vimtex. However, if one uses other compiler
  methods, either through vimtex (see |g:vimtex_compiler_method|) or
  externally, this requirement must be ensured by the user.

  Default value: 'latexlog'

*g:vimtex_quickfix_blgparser*
  This option controls the parsing of `blg` log files (created by bibtex or
  biber) for warnings and errors.  The option is a dictionary with the
  following keys:

    disable~
      Disable the parsing of `blg` entries.

  Default value: {}

*g:vimtex_quickfix_autojump*
  This option controls if vim should automatically jump to the first error
  whenever the |quickfix| window is opened.

  Note: This option does not go well with continuous compilation and
        callbacks, since the callbacks will open the quickfix window if there
        are errors.  Thus I recommend to keep it disabled for continuous
        compilation, and rather enable it if one prefers single shot
        compilations.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog*
  This option configures the `latexlog` error parser. It is a dictionary that
  specifies which warnings to include. By default, all warnings are enabled
  and have to be specifically disabled. However, it is possible to use the
  entry `disable` to disable either all warnings, or all package warnings, if
  so desired.
  Warnings by following packages can be disabled individually:
  `babel`, `biblatex`, `fixltx2e`, `hyperref`, `natbib`, `scrreprt`, and `titlesec`.
  The entry `general` under packages can be used to turn off messages of
  packages matching the pattern >

    Package .* Warning: %m on input line %l.
<
  Note: Messages by `natbib` follow also this pattern but have to be turned
        off with the entry `natbib`.

  One may provide a list of |regular-expression|s with the key `ignore_filters`
  to further customize which entries to include.

  Some examples may be helpful: >

    " Disable all warnings
    let g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog = {'default' : 0}

    " Disable undefined reference warnings
    let g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog = {'references' : 0}

    " Disable overfull/underfull \hbox and all package warnings
    let g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog = {
          \ 'overfull' : 0,
          \ 'underfull' : 0,
          \ 'packages' : {
          \   'default' : 0,
          \ },
          \}

    " Disable custom warnings based on regexp
    let g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog = {
          \ 'ignore_filters' : ['Marginpar on page'],
          \}
<
  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog = {
          \ 'default' : 1,
          \ 'ignore_filters' : [],
          \ 'general' : 1,
          \ 'references' : 1,
          \ 'overfull' : 1,
          \ 'underfull' : 1,
          \ 'font' : 1,
          \ 'packages' : {
          \   'default' : 1,
          \   'general' : 1,
          \   'babel' : 1,
          \   'biblatex' : 1,
          \   'fixltx2e' : 1,
          \   'hyperref' : 1,
          \   'natbib' : 1,
          \   'scrreprt' : 1,
          \   'titlesec' : 1,
          \ },
          \}
<
*g:vimtex_quickfix_mode*
  This option controls the behaviour of the |quickfix| window in case errors
  and/or warnings are found.  The recognized options are:

  Value  Effect ~
  0      The quickfix window is never opened/closed automatically.
  1      The quickfix window is opened automatically when there are errors,
         and it becomes the active window.
  2      The quickfix window is opened automatically when there are errors,
         but it does not become the active window.

  Note: The quickfix window will only be opened automatically if the compiler
        is set to `continuous` mode and has `callbacks` enabled, or if
        `continuous` mode is disabled and one uses the `nvim` or `jobs` backends.

  Default value: 2

*g:vimtex_quickfix_autoclose_after_keystrokes*
  If set to value greater than zero, then the quickfix window will close after
  this number of motions (i.e. |CursorMoved| and |CursorMovedI| events). This
  is most useful if one sets |g:vimtex_quickfix_mode| to 2, in which case this
  option allows one to continue editing and removing the distraction of the
  quickfix window automatically.

  Note: The count is reset when the quickfix window is entered.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_quickfix_open_on_warning*
  Control whether or not to automatically open the |quickfix| window in case
  there are warning messages and no error messages.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_syntax_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable |vimtex| improved syntax highlighting.

  Default value: 1.

*g:vimtex_syntax_nested*
  A dictionary for configuring nested syntaxes. Has two keys: `aliases` and
  `ignored`.

  The `aliases` key holds a dictionary of aliases, such as mapping `C` to `c`.
  This is useful e.g. because the Vim syntax files are case sensitive.

  The `ignored` key holds a dictionary of ignore lists for each language. This
  is useful to ignore some groups that may conflict in e.g. the `\begin{...}`
  or `\end{...}` part of the nested syntax regions.

  Default value: >

    let g:vimtex_syntax_nested = {
        \ 'aliases' : {
        \   'C' : 'c',
        \   'csharp' : 'cs',
        \ },
        \ 'ignored' : {
        \   'python' : [
        \     'pythonEscape',
        \     'pythonBEscape',
        \     'pythonBytesEscape',
        \   ]
        \ }
        \})

*g:vimtex_texcount_custom_arg*
  Option that makes it possible to add custom arguments to `texcount` for
  |VimtexCountWords| and |VimtexCountLetters|.

  Default value: ''

*g:vimtex_text_obj_enabled*
  Use this option to disable the text object mappings.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_text_obj_linewise_operators*
  List of operators that will act linewise on the delimiter text objects (i.e.
  `ie/ae`, `i$/a$`, and `id/ad`). Note, for inline regions the operators will not
  act linewise, since that would lead to side effects.

  Default value: ['d', 'y']

*g:vimtex_text_obj_variant*
  Select text object variants for command and environment text objects. The
  choice is either `vimtex` or |targets.vim|. Possible configuration options
  are:

    1. `'auto'`     (select `'targets'` if |targets.vim| is installed)
    2. `'vimtex'`
    3. `'targets'`

  When using `'targets'`, the following additional text object kinds are
  available:

  - Prefix `I` and `A` instead of `i` and `a` for excluding inner whitespace or
    including outer whitespace, respectively.
  - Modifier `n` and `l` for next or previous (mnemonic: last).

  For more details, see `doc/targets-textobj-cheatsheet.md`.

  Default value: `'auto'`

*g:vimtex_toc_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable table of contents (ToC).

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_toc_custom_matchers*
  This option is a list of custom ToC matchers. A matcher is used to define
  the entries that are included in the ToC window. It is implemented as
  a |Dictionary| with a specified set of keys, see below for the
  specification.

  As an example, one can use this option to add ToC entries for a custom
  environment. Say you have defined an environment `mycustomenv`, then
  instances of this environment could be added to the ToC with the following
  configuration: >

    let g:vimtex_toc_custom_matchers = [
            \ { 'title' : 'My Custom Environment',
            \   're' : '\v^\s*\\begin\{mycustomenv\}' }
            \]
<
  Default value: []

                                                    *toc_matcher_specification*
  A ToC matcher is defined as a |Dictionary| where the possible keys are
  specified below. In order to write a matcher, one should also be aware of
  the `context` argument that is passed to the matcher functions, as well as
  the specification of the `toc entry` return value. However, since this kind
  of customization is advanced I refer users to the source file for further
  specification of these objects. In particular, see the function
  `s:toc.parse(...)` in `autoload/vimtex/toc.vim`.

    re~
      Type: |String|
      Required: `yes`
      This specifies a regular expression that should match the current line
      for the desired ToC entry.

    prefilter~
      Type: |String|
      Required: `maybe`
      This specifies a `simplified` regular expression that should match the
      current line for the desired ToC entry. This is used in order to make
      things faster. The `re` key may often be a complex and therefore slow
      regular expression. This key should represent a simple and fast regular
      expression that may match more then the desired entry.

    in_preamble~
      Type: 0 or 1
      Required: `yes`
      If the entry may appear in the preamble.

    in_content~
      Type: 0 or 1
      Required: `yes`
      If the entry may appear in the main content.

    title~
      Type: |String|
      Required: `no`
      If the matcher does not have a `get_entry` key, then it will use
      a simple, general matcher function to generate the entry. In this case,
      the `title` key should be specified to give the title of the ToC entry.

    get_entry~
      Type: |Dictionary-function|
      Arguments: `context`
      Returns: `toc entry`
      Required: `no`
      This is the general way to define ToC entries. It allows to define the
      ToC entry based on the context. See `autoload/vimtex/parser/toc.vim` for
      examples on how to use this.

    continue~
      Type: |Dictionary-function|
      Arguments: `context`
      Returns: `toc entry`
      Required: `no`
      Some entries may be specified over several lines, in which case this key
      becomes necessary in combination with the `get_entry` key. See the built
      in `s:matcher_section` matcher for an example on how to use this.

*g:vimtex_toc_todo_keywords*
  Set list of keywords that should be recognized in comments for the todo
  layer.

  Default value: `['TODO', 'FIXME']`

*g:vimtex_toc_show_preamble*
  Whether to include the preamble in the ToC.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_toc_config*
  This is a dictionary that can be used to configure the ToC. Each key
  specifies a configuration option that can be changed. In the following, the
  various keys are explained briefly and the default value is indicated.

    `name` : `Table of contents (vimtex)`
      The name of the ToC buffer.

    `mode` : 1
      The ToC display mode, one of:
        1: Separate window.
        2: Separate window and location list.
        3: Location list (and don't open it).
        4: Location list (and open it).

    `fold_enable` : 0
      Wheter to enable folding in the ToC window.

    `fold_level_start` : -1
      The starting fold level. The value -1 indicates that the start level is
      the same as the `tocdepth` value.

    `hide_line_numbers` : 1
      If enabled, then line numbers will be hidden in the ToC window by
      setting |nonumber| and |norelativenumber| locally.

    `hotkeys_enabled` : 0
      Set to 1 to enable individual hotkeys for ToC entries.

    `hotkeys` : `abcdegijklmnopuvxyz`
      A string of keys that are used to create individual hotkeys.

    `hotkeys_leader` : `;`
      The hotkey leader. Set to empty string to disable the leader.

    `layers` : Undefined
    `layer_status` : Dictionary >
        { 'content': 1,
          'label': 1,
          'todo': 1,
          'include': 1 }
<      The initial state of the layers (1 for active, 0 for inactive). The
      `layers` key may be used as a shorthand: it accepts a list of layers
      that should be active.

    `layer_keys` : Dictionary >
        { 'content': 'C',
          'label': 'L',
          'todo': 'T',
          'include': 'I'}
<      Specify hotkeys for enabling/disabling the different layers.

    `resize` : 0
      Whether or not to automatically resize vim when index windows are
      opened.

      Note: This option makes sense if the index window is vertically split.

    `refresh_always` : 1
      Set to 0 to manually refresh ToC entries. This may be useful for very
      large projects where generating the ToC entries becomes slow.

      It may be useful to combine manually refreshing with a |BufWritePost|
      autocommand, e.g.: >

        augroup vimtex
          autocmd!
          autocmd BufWritePost *.tex call vimtex#toc#refresh()
        augroup END
<
      Or, if preferred, one may use a mapping such as: >

        nnoremap <silent> <localleader>lf :call vimtex#toc#refresh()
<
    `show_help` : 1
      Whether to display the index help text.

    `show_numbers` : 1
      Set whether or not to show section numbers in ToC.

    `split_pos` : `vert leftabove`
      Define where index windows should be opened. This is a string that
      contains either the word 'full' to open in the current window, or
      a position command. Use |:vert| if a vertical split is desired, and one
      of |:leftabove|, |:rightbelow|, |:topleft|, and |:botright| to specify
      the desired split position.

    `split_width` : 30
      For vertically split windows: Set width of index window.

    `tocdepth` : 3
      Define the depth of section levels to display. This attempts to mimic
      the corresponding latex variable `tocdepth`. For more info, see:
      http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=LaTeX/Document_Structure

      Note: This will also change the width of the number column according to
            the space needed to show the section numbers.

    `todo_sorted` : 1
      Whether or not to sort the TODOs at the top of the ToC window.

*g:vimtex_view_enabled*
  Use this option to disable/enable the |vimtex| viewer interface.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_view_automatic*
  If enabled, the viewer will open automatically when compilation has started
  in `continuous` mode and if `callback` is enabled, or if `continuous` mode
  is disabled and one uses either the `jobs` or the `nvim` backend.

  `latexmk` will typically start the viewer directly.  However, with this
  option enabled, |vimtex| will start the viewer through callbacks also for
  the |vimtex-latexrun|, |vimtex-arara| and |vimtex-tectonic| compilers.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_view_method*
  Set the viewer method.

  Note that the general viewer |vimtex_viewer_general| defines a generic
  interface that allows sufficient customization for most viewer applications.

  Possible values:
    'general' (default)
    'mupdf'
    'skim'
    'zathura'

    *vimtex_viewer_general*
      This is a generic interface where the viewer application is specified
      through |g:vimtex_view_general_viewer| and the viewer options are given
      with |g:vimtex_view_general_options|.  With the `latexmk` compiler, the
      viewer is started after successful compilation with the options provided
      by |g:vimtex_view_general_options_latexmk|.  The interface allows the
      general viewer to support forward search with a lot of different
      applications:

        *vimtex_viewer_okular*
          https://okular.kde.org/
          Okular is a very feature rich PDF viewer that supports forward
          and backward search. Recommended settings are: >

            let g:vimtex_view_general_viewer = 'okular'
            let g:vimtex_view_general_options = '--unique file:@pdf\#src:@line@tex'
            let g:vimtex_view_general_options_latexmk = '--unique'
<
          Backward search must be set up from the viewer through
          "Settings > Editor > Custom Text Editor". The following settings
          should work for Vim and neovim (Note: see |vimtex_faq_neovim|),
          respectively: >

            vim --remote-silent +%l "%f"
            nvr --remote-silent +%l "%f"

            " Or with arguably more convenient reverse goto function:
            vim --remote-expr "vimtex#view#reverse_goto(%l, '%f')"

            " For neovim it may be convenient to specify servername
            nvr --servername /tmp/nvimserver --remote-silent +%l "%f"
<
          Note: To perform a backward (or inverse) search in Okular, you do
                "shift + click", not "ctrl + click" as in most other viewers.

            " or, for neovim, if the servername is specified
            nvr --servername /tmp/nvimserver --remote-silent +%l "%f"

          Note: With |neovim|, it is useful to start the LaTeX editing session
                with `nvim --listen /tmp/nvimserver` (e.g. by using an alias)
                so as to use a predictable servername. Then one may specify
                the servername in the "Custom Text Editor" as indicated above.

        *vimtex_viewer_evince*
          https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evince
          > Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. The
          > goal of evince is to replace the multiple document viewers that
          > exist on the GNOME Desktop with a single simple application.

          Recommended settings are: >

            let g:vimtex_view_general_viewer = 'evince'
<
          Note: It is not so easy to setup forward and backward search with
                Evince [0]. If anyone has a good setup that could be
                documented here, please open an issue or email me. In the
                meantime, I can recommend to look into the other alternative
                viewers.

<
          Backward search can be set up either in the viewer or in (g)Vim by
          the adding the following lines to your vimrc: >

            let g:vimtex_view_general_options
                \ = '-reuse-instance -forward-search @tex @line @pdf'
                \ . ' -inverse-search "' . exepath(v:progpath)
                \ . ' --servername ' . v:servername

                \ . ':call remote_foreground('''.v:servername.''')^<CR^>^<CR^>\""'
<
          Note: There is a known issue with vimtex + SumatraPDF when you use
                `xelatex`, where the pdf file in SumatraPDF is not refreshed
                after compilation. A workaround was found and posted by
                @Whitebeard0 here:
                https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1410#issuecomment-506143020

    *vimtex_viewer_mupdf*
      http://www.mupdf.com/
      A very minimalistic and quick PDF viewer.  Supports forward and backward
      search.  Backward search is available with |VimtexRSearch|, which is
      mapped to '<localleader>lr'.  One may also define a set of keys that is
      sent to MuPDF on startup with |g:vimtex_view_mupdf_send_keys|.

      Note: Both forward and backward search requires `xdotool` to work.
            Forward search will only take you to the correct page.  Backward
            search will take you to the line in Vim that corresponds to the
            first line of the current page in MuPDF.

      Note: Viewer handling uses window title matching. If there exists
            another pdf viewer with the same name as the current project pdf
            file, then there might be conflicts, and so MuPDF might not work
            as expected.

    *vimtex_viewer_skim*
      http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/
      Skim is a PDF reader and note-taker for OS X.  It is designed to help
      you read and annotate scientific papers in PDF, but is also great
      for viewing any PDF file. The vimtex implementation supports forward
      search and uses a callback to update Skim after successful compilations.

      Note: One may set |g:vimtex_view_automatic| to 1 if one wants to prevent
            `latexmk` (or other build tools) from starting Skim and instead
            let vimtex start Skim through the callback feature.

      Note: See |vimtex-faq-skimviewer| for more info on how to properly set
            up the Skim viewer for backward search.

    *vimtex_viewer_zathura*
      https://pwmt.org/projects/zathura/
      Zathura is like MuPDF a very fast and minimalistic viewer, but it allows
      more user configuration.  Zathura supports forward search and backward
      search.

      Note: Forward search requires `xdotool` to work properly, in order to
            not open a new Zathura instance for invocation of |VimtexView|.

      Note: Recent versions of Zathura no longer ensures synctex support. This
            has resulted in synctex support being dropped on some platforms,
            e.g. on OpenSUSE, cf. https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/384.
            A workaround is to build Zathura from source manually.

      Note: Viewer handling uses window title matching. If there exists
            another pdf viewer with the same name as the current project pdf
            file, then there might be conflicts. In particular, this might
            affect forward/backward searching for Zathura.

*g:vimtex_view_use_temp_files*
  If nonzero, this will copy output files to a corresponding set of files
  with `_vimtex` prepended to the name. If one combines this with the callback
  feature, this may provide a very convenient way to avoid that the pdf
  becomes unavailable during compilation, as it will only update the viewer
  outut file after a successful compilation.

  The behaviour depends on the value:

    1: Copy output files after successful compilations and then update.
    2: Copy output files after all compilations and then update.

  Note: This is only relevant for the `latexmk` compiler backend. `latexrun`
        already ensures that the output file is updated only after the
        compilation is completed.

  Note: This will disable the viewer from the `latexmk` end. That is, if this
        option is enabled, opening and updating the pdf viewer will have to be
        done by the user or by vimtex, even if `latexmk` is chosen as the
        compiler.

  Note: This works best with the 'mupdf' and 'zathura' viewers. In particular,
        these viewers should update automatically after the pdf is updated.
        For general viewers, one has to create a callback function and connect
        it through |g:vimtex_view_general_callback|, and then use this
        callback to update the viewer.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_view_forward_search_on_start*
  If disabled, the first invocation of the viewer will not perform a forward
  search to the current cursor position.

  Note: This option is only relevant for the following view methods (see
  |g:vimtex_view_method|):
    'mupdf'
    'zathura'

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_view_general_viewer*
  Use generic viewer application, see |vimtex_viewer_general|.

  Default value:
    Linux: `xdg-open`
    Mac:   `open`

*g:vimtex_view_general_options*
  Set options for the specified general viewer, see |vimtex_viewer_general|.
  The options are parsed to substitute the following keywords:

    `@pdf`    Path to pdf file
    `@tex`    Path to tex file
    `@line`   Current line number
    `@col`    Current column number

  Default value: '@pdf'

*g:vimtex_view_general_options_latexmk*
  Set options that are passed on to `latexmk` for the specified general
  viewer, see |vimtex_viewer_general|.  This allows to send options that
  ensures a unique viewer, e.g. with |vimtex_viewer_qpdfview|. Only the
  `@line` escape is expanded.

  Note: This option is only relevant with |vimtex-latexmk| as the compiler.

  Default value: ''

*g:vimtex_view_general_callback*
  Sets the name of a function that is called within |vimtex#compiler#callback|
  after compilation has finished. The function takes a single argument, which
  is the status flag (1 for success, 0 for failure). Within the function, one
  can use the `b:vimtex` variable directly, e.g. the pdf file is available as
  `b:vimtex.out()`. The function is part of the viewer dictionary, and as such
  it may be defined with the |func-dict| argument. See the source for the
  reference of the viewer dictionary.

  Default value: ''

*g:vimtex_view_mupdf_options*
  Set options for mupdf (|vimtex_viewer_mupdf|).

  Default value: ''

*g:vimtex_view_mupdf_send_keys*
  A string of keys that will be sent to MuPDF just after the PDF file has been
  opened.

  Default value: ''

*g:vimtex_view_skim_activate*
  Set this option to 1 to make Skim have focus after command |:VimtexView| in
  addition to being moved to the foreground.

  Default value: 0

*g:vimtex_view_skim_reading_bar*
  Set this option to 1 to highlight current line in PDF after command
  |:VimtexView|.

  Default value: 1

*g:vimtex_view_zathura_options*
  Set options for zathura (|vimtex_viewer_zathura|).

  Default value: ''

                          a compiler toggle. If not, this command will run
                          a single shot compilation.

:VimtexCompileSelected    Compile the selected part of the current LaTeX file.
                          When used as a command, it takes a range, e.g.: >

                            :start,end VimtexCompileSelected

<                          When used as a normal mode mapping, the mapping
                          will act as an |operator| on the following motion or
                          text object. Finally, when used as a visual mode
                          mapping, it will act on the selected lines.

                          Note: This always works linewise!

                                background (which is the default behaviour),
                                then this command will first temporarily stop
                                compilation, then execute the clean command,
                                and finally restart the compilation.

:VimtexCountLetters       Shows the number of letters/characters or words in
:VimtexCountWords         the current project or in the selected region. The
                          count is created with `texcount` through a call on
                          the main project file similar to: >

                            texcount -nosub -sum [-letter] -merge -q -1 FILE
<
                          Note: Default arguments may be controlled with
                                |g:vimtex_texcount_custom_arg|.

                          Note: One may access the information through the
                                function `vimtex#misc#wordcount(opts)`, where
                                `opts` is a dictionary with the following
                                keys (defaults indicated): >

                                'range' : [1, line('$')]
                                'count_letters' : 0/1
                                'detailed' : 0
<
                                If `detailed` is 0, then it only returns the
                                total count. This makes it possible to use for
                                e.g. statusline functions. If the `opts` dict
                                is not passed, then the defaults are assumed.

:VimtexImapsList          Show the list of insert mode mappings created by the
                          |vimtex-imaps| feature. The mappings are displayed
                          in a scratch buffer. Press `q` or `<esc>` to close
                          the buffer.

                                             *VimtexToggleMain*
                                             *<plug>(vimtex-toggle-main)*
:VimtexToggleMain         In general, |vimtex| detects the main file for the
                          current LaTeX project and uses it for compilation
                          and many other features. However, in some cases it
                          may be useful to instead focus on the current file,
                          for instance in large projects. In such cases, one
                          can use |VimtexToggleMain| to change which file to
                          use as the "current project". It is easy to toggle
                          back and forth, and both the "main project" and the
                          "local project" can be used simultaneously if
                          desired (e.g. for compilation).

                          Note: To compile the current file when it is part of
                                a larger project, one must of course include
                                a preamble and the `\begin/\end{document}`! It is
                                possible to have a working preamble in every
                                file in a multi-file project with `subfiles`,
                                see |vimtex-subfiles|.

MAP DEFINITIONS                                               *vimtex-mappings*

*vimtex-zx*
  When |vimtex| folding is enabled and when the manual mode is turned on
  (|g:vimtex_fold_manual|), then |vimtex| remaps |zx| and |zX| in such that
  the folds are refreshed appropriately.

*<plug>(vimtex-env-delete)*
*<plug>(vimtex-env-delete-math)*
*<plug>(vimtex-env-change)*
*<plug>(vimtex-env-change-math)*
  Delete/Change surrounding environment. When changing, there will be
  sensible completion candidates, see |cmdline-completion|. See also
  |g:vimtex_env_change_autofill| and |g:vimtex_echo_verbose_input|.

*<plug>(vimtex-cmd-delete)*
*<plug>(vimtex-cmd-delete-math)*
*<plug>(vimtex-cmd-change)*
  Delete/Change surrounding command. See also |g:vimtex_echo_verbose_input|.

*<plug>(vimtex-delim-delete)*
*<plug>(vimtex-delim-change-math)*
  Delete/Change surrounding (math) delimiter. See also
  |g:vimtex_echo_verbose_input|.

*<plug>(vimtex-cmd-toggle-star)*
*<plug>(vimtex-env-toggle-star)*
  Toggle starred command/environment.

*<plug>(vimtex-delim-toggle-modifier)*
*<plug>(vimtex-delim-toggle-modifier-reverse)*
  Toggle delimiter modifiers, by default alternating between `(...)` and
  `\left(...\right)`.  The normal mode mapping toggles the closest surrounding
  delimiter, whereas the visual mode mapping toggles all delimiters that are
  fully contained in the visual selection.  The visual selection is preserved.

  When |g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list| is set to contain more than one set of
  modifiers, these mappings iterate through the list instead of just toggling.
  For example, one may alternate between `(...)`, `\bigl(...\bigr)`,
  `\Bigl(...\Bigr)`, and so on.  These mappings accept a [count], which allows
  the modifier to be incremented multiple steps at a time.  The `-reverse`
  mapping goes backwards through the modifier list instead of forwards.

  See also |g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list| and |g:vimtex_delim_list|.

*<plug>(vimtex-cmd-create)*
  This mapping works in both insert mode, normal mode and visual mode. It is
  mapped by default to <f7>. See below for the behaviour in the different
  modes.

  Insert mode:
    Convert the preceding text into a LaTeX command. That is, it prepends
    a backslash and adds an opening brace. It also moves the cursor to the end
    of the word.

  Normal/Visual mode:
    Surrounds the word under the cursor/visual selection by the command
    provided in an input prompt.

*<plug>(vimtex-delim-close)*
  Close the current environment or delimiter (insert mode).


Note: The following describe text objects and motions. For the text objects,
the usual convention is used where the "a" select "a"n object, including the
whitespace/delimiters/etc, whereas the "i" selects the corresponding "inner"
object, see |text-objects|.

*<plug>(vimtex-ac)*
*<plug>(vimtex-ic)*
  Text object for commands.

*<plug>(vimtex-ad)*
*<plug>(vimtex-id)*
  Text object for delimiters.

INSERT MODE MAPPINGS                                             *vimtex-imaps*

Some LaTeX commands are very common, and so it is both natural and convenient
to have insert mode mappings/abbreviations for them. |vimtex| therefore
provides a list of such mappings that are enabled by default, see
|g:vimtex_imaps_list|. The mappings utilize a map leader defined by
|g:vimtex_imaps_leader|. The default list of maps are all math mode mappings,
but one may also add mappings that are available and useful outside of math
mode. To see the list of mappings that are created, one can use the command
|VimtexImapsList|, which is by default mapped to `<localleader>lm`.

It is of course possible to customize the list of mappings. First, one may
specifically disable a default mapping through |g:vimtex_imaps_disabled|.
Second, one may specify |g:vimtex_imaps_list|, which will overwrite the
default list. Finally, one may add new maps through calls to the function
|vimtex#imap#add_map|. The following are some examples of how to customize the
mappings: >

  " Disable \alpha and \beta mappings
  let g:vimtex_imaps_disabled = ['a', 'b']

  " Add custom mapping through vimtex#imap#add_map
  call vimtex#imaps#add_map({
    \ 'lhs' : 'test',
    \ 'rhs' : '\tested',
    \ 'wrapper' : 'vimtex#imaps#wrap_trivial'
    \})
<
                                                         *vimtex#imaps#add_map*

This function is used to add new insert mode mappings. It takes a single
dictionary argument: >

  map = {
    \ 'lhs' : lhs,
    \ 'rhs' : rhs,
    \ 'leader' : leader_key,
    \ 'wrapper' : function_name,
    \ 'context' : value,
    \ }

Explanation of the keys:

  lhs~
    Mandatory argument. The left-hand side part of the map.

  lhs_rhs~
    Mandatory argument. The right-hand side part of the map.

  leader~
    Custom leader key. If the key is not present, then |g:vimtex_imaps_leader|
    is used as leader key.

  wrapper~
    The name of a wrapper function that is used to generate the `rhs`. Two
    functions are available from |vimtex|:

      `vimtex#imaps#wrap_trivial`
        Trivial wrapper: Simply returns `rhs`.

      `vimtex#imaps#wrap_math`
        Only define `rhs` if inside a math environment. This is the default
        wrapper function and will be used if no other wrapper is supplied.

      `vimtex#imaps#wrap_environment`
        Only define `rhs` if inside a specified environment. The wrapper works
        by utilizing the `context` key, which is a list that contains strings
        and/or dictionaries:

          i.  If the entry is a string, then the `lhs` is mapped to `rhs`
              inside the specified environment.
          ii. If the entry is a dictionary, then we assume it has two entries,
              `envs` and `rhs`, where `envs` is a list of environment names.
              If inside any environment in this list, then we expand to the
              corresponding `rhs`. This allows one to create a mapping that
              expands to different `rhs`s in different environments.

    Of course, one may use custom wrapper functions. To write a custom wrapper
    function, please see the source for examples on how the |vimtex| wrappers
    are written.

  context~
    A value that can be used by the chosen wrapper function.

                                                            *vimtex-neosnippet*
                                                             *vimtex-UltiSnips*
Note: that this feature is not the same as the snippet feature of |UltiSnips|
or |neosnippet|. The imaps feature of |vimtex| previously supported `automatic`
snippets, but these have been removed after careful considerations and input
from |vimtex| users, please see vimtex issue #295:
https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/295#issuecomment-164262446
It has been decided that the best approach is to only provide basic mappings,
and to let users manully create automatic snippets through the anonymous
snippet functions in |UltiSnips| and |neosnippet|, please see |UltiSnips#Anon|
and |neosnippet#anonymous|, respectively. Here are a couple of examples that
show how to create such mappings: >

    " Using neosnippet#anonymous
    inoremap <silent><expr> __ neosnippet#anonymous('_${1}${0}')
    inoremap <silent><expr> ^^ neosnippet#anonymous('^${1}${0}')

    " Using UltiSnips#Anon
    inoremap <silent> __ __<c-r>=UltiSnips#Anon('_{$1}$0', '__', '', 'i')<cr>
    inoremap <silent> ^^ ^^<c-r>=UltiSnips#Anon('^{$1}$0', '^^', '', 'i')<cr>

A drawback with the anonymous UltiSnips snippets is that they do not nest.
That is, if you did `__` twice in a row, only the second one could be escaped.
In recent versions of |UltiSnips|, one may set normal snippets to trigger
automatically, see |UltiSnips-autotrigger|. This allows nesting, and is
therefore a better approach than using the anonymous snippet function.

EVENTS                                                          *vimtex-events*

|vimtex| defines some events using the |User| autocmd that may be used for
further customization.

  *VimtexEventQuit*
    This event is triggered when the last buffer for a particular LaTeX project
    is wiped (for example, using `:bwipeout`) and when Vim is quit.  The event
    may be used, for instance, to cleanup up auxiliary build files or close
    open viewers (see Examples below).  With Vim defaults, this event is not
    triggered when using `:quit` or `:bdelete` since these commands merely hide
    the buffer.  In multi-file projects, the event may be triggered multiple
    times.  The 'b:vimtex' variable contains context data for the quitting
    file or project.  For example, 'b:vimtex.tex' identifies the tex file being
    wiped, or the main tex file of a multi-file project.

    Note: Commands such as |VimtexClean| cannot be used in this autocommand
    because when quitting vim the current buffer does not necessarily have
    filetype 'tex'.

  *VimtexEventInitPost*
    This event is triggered after |vimtex| initialization is completed.  It may
    be used to automatically start compiling a document.

  *VimtexEventCompileStarted*
    This event is triggered after compilation is started (in continuous mode).

  *VimtexEventCompileStopped*
    This event is triggered after compilation is stopped.

Examples: >

  " Compile on initialization, cleanup on quit
  augroup vimtex_event_1
    au!
    au User VimtexEventQuit     call vimtex#compiler#clean(0)
    au User VimtexEventInitPost call vimtex#compiler#compile()
  augroup END

  " Close viewers on quit
  function! CloseViewers()
    if executable('xdotool') && exists('b:vimtex')
        \ && exists('b:vimtex.viewer') && b:vimtex.viewer.xwin_id > 0
      call system('xdotool windowclose '. b:vimtex.viewer.xwin_id)
    endif
  endfunction

  augroup vimtex_event_2
    au!
    au User VimtexEventQuit call CloseViewers()
  augroup END

==============================================================================
COMPLETION                                                  *vimtex-completion*

If |g:vimtex_complete_enabled| is 1 (default), then |vimtex| sets the
'omnifunc' to provide omni completion, see |compl-omni|.  Omni completion is
then accessible with |i_CTRL-X_CTRL-O|.

The omni completion completes citations, labels, glossary entries and
filenames. If desired, one may set |g:vimtex_complete_close_braces|, which
makes the completion include closing braces.

Associated settings:
- |g:vimtex_complete_bib|
- |g:vimtex_complete_close_braces|
- |g:vimtex_complete_enabled|
- |g:vimtex_complete_ignore_case|
- |g:vimtex_complete_ref|
- |g:vimtex_complete_smart_case|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE CITATIONS                                      *vimtex-complete-cites*

Citation completion is triggered by '\cite{' commands.  The completion parses
included bibliography files (`*.bib`) and `thebibliography` environments to
gather the completion candidates.

By default, cite completion is "smart" in that it allows to complete on
author name, title and similar. As an example, assume that a bibliography file
is included with the following entry: >

        @book { knuth1981,
                author = "Donald E. Knuth",
                title = "Seminumerical Algorithms",
                publisher = "Addison-Wesley",
                year = "1981" }

Then the bibliography key `knuth1981` will be completed with e.g.: >

        \cite{Knuth 1981<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
        \cite{algo<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
        \cite{Don.*Knuth<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>

In particular, note that regular expressions (or vim patterns) can be used
after '\cite{' to search for candidates. By default, the regex is applied to
the completion menu, which is defined by |g:vimtex_complete_bib.menu_fmt|.

However, if one prefers, one may set the `simple` key of |g:vimtex_complete_bib|
to only allow completion on the bibkeys directly. This should typically work
better with autocomplete plugins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE LABELS                                        *vimtex-complete-labels*

Label completion is triggered by `\ref{` commands.  The completion parses every
relevant aux file to gather the completion candidates.  This is important,
because it means that the completion only works when the LaTeX document has
been compiled.

As an example: >

        \ref{sec:<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>

offers a list of all matching labels with a menu that contains the associated
value and page number.

The completion base is matched as a regex in the following order: >

        \ref{<base><CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<
    1. The menu, which contains the reference value and page number.
    2. The actual labels.
    3. The menu and label, separated by whitespace. An example: >

        \ref{eq 2<CTRL-X><CTRL-O>
<
       This matches "eq" in the label and "2" in the menu.

Finally, it should also be mentioned that for `\eqref`, the candidates will
automatically be filtered to only show equation references.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE COMMANDS AND ENVIRONMENTS                   *vimtex-complete-commands*
                                                 *vimtex-complete-environments*

Command completion is available after `\` and should provide completion
candidates for relevant LaTeX commands.  The document's preamble is analysed,
and commands will be completed for the loaded packages as well as those
defined within the preamble using `\newcommand`, `\let` and `\def`.  Environment
completion is also available after `\begin{` or `\end{`.  As with commands, the
suggested environment names come from the loaded packages and `\newenvironment`
definitions in the preamble.

A lot of packages are supported, see the path `VIMTEX/autoload/vimtex/complete`
for a relevant file listing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE FILE NAMES                                 *vimtex-complete-filenames*

File name completion is available for the following macros:

  `\includegraphics{`
    Completes image file names.

  `\input{`
  `\include{`
  `\includeonly{`
    Complete `.tex` files.

  `\includepdf{`
    Complete `.pdf` files. This macro is provided by the `pdfpages` package.

  `\includestandalone{`
    Complete `.tex` files. This macro is provided by the `standalone` package.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE INCLUDE GLOSSARY ENTRIES                    *vimtex-complete-glossary*

Glossary entry completion from the `glossaries` package are triggered by the
commands '\gls{', '\glspl{' and their variations.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMPLETE PACKAGE FILES                               *vimtex-complete-packages*
                                                      *vimtex-complete-classes*
                                                     *vimtex-complete-bibstyle*

Package, documentclass, and bibliography style completion are available for
the `\usepackage{`, `\documentclass{`, and `\bibliographystyle` commands,
respectively.

The completion relies on the contents of `ls-R` files that are found with: >

  kpsewhich --all ls-R

Packages and documentclasses installed at `TEXMFHOME` will also be searched.
The default value can be found with: >

  kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFHOME

Note: If you want to change the default value of `TEXMFHOME` in your shell
      startup file and use `gvim` started from the desktop environment, please
      read |vimtex-faq-texmfhome|.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AUTOCOMPLETE                                             *vimtex-complete-auto*

Vim does not provide automatic completion by itself, but there exist at least
several good plugins that provide this: |coc.nvim|, |deoplete|, |neocomplete|, |ncm2|,
|nvim-completion-manager| and |youcompleteme|.  Moreover, there is |VimCompletesMe|
that overrides <tab> to trigger different built-in completions, such as the
omni-completion by vimtex, depending on the context. See below for
descriptions on how to setup these with |vimtex|.

coc.nvim~
                                                     *vimtex-complete-coc.nvim*
|coc.nvim| is an intellisense engine for Vim8 & Neovim. It's a completion
framework and language server client which supports extension features of
Visual Studio Code. The project is here: https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim.

|coc.nvim| can be installed using vim-plug: >

  Plug 'neoclide/coc.nvim'

However, it does require some more steps, and users are recommended to read
the installation instructions in the `coc.nvim` wiki:
https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Install-coc.nvim

To configure for `vimtex`, one should use the extension plugin |coc-vimtex|,
which may be found here: https://github.com/neoclide/coc-vimtex. To use it,
first make sure you have |coc.nvim| installed, then just run: >

  :CocInstall coc-vimtex

Additionally, you can configure code completion for TeX by setting these
options in |coc.nvim|'s configuration file `coc-settings.json` >

  coc.source.vimtex.disableSyntaxes // disabled syntax names
  coc.source.vimtex.enable          // set to false to disable this source
  coc.source.vimtex.priority        // priority of source, default 99
  coc.source.vimtex.shortcut        // shortcut used in menu of completion item

deoplete~
                                                     *vimtex-complete-deoplete*
|deoplete| is a modern remake of |neocomplete|, and was originally written
specifically for Neovim, see here: https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim. It
is a highly customizable and flexible completion manager.

To configure for `vimtex`, one may use: >

  " This is new style
  call deoplete#custom#var('omni', 'input_patterns', {
          \ 'tex': g:vimtex#re#deoplete
          \})

  " This is old style (deprecated)
  if !exists('g:deoplete#omni#input_patterns')
      let g:deoplete#omni#input_patterns = {}
  endif
  let g:deoplete#omni#input_patterns.tex = g:vimtex#re#deoplete

neocomplete~
                                                  *vimtex-complete-neocomplete*
|neocomplete| is also a flexible automatic completion engine for vim, although
active development has been stopped. Users are recommended to change to
|deoplete|, see also |vimtex-complete-deoplete|. The plugin is available here:
https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim.

The following options may be used to enable automatic completion for LaTeX
documents with |neocomplete| and |vimtex|s omni completion function: >

  if !exists('g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns')
    let g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns = {}
  endif
  let g:neocomplete#sources#omni#input_patterns.tex =
        \ g:vimtex#re#neocomplete

ncm2~
                                                         *vimtex-complete-ncm2*
|ncm2| is a modern remake and replacement of |nvim-completion-manager| and is
supposed to be a "Slim, Fast and Hackable Completion Framework for Neovim":
https://github.com/ncm2/ncm2

The following simple configuration should work well with `vimtex`: >

  " include the following plugins (here using junnegun/vim-plug)
  Plug 'roxma/nvim-yarp'
  Plug 'ncm2/ncm2'

  set completeopt=noinsert,menuone,noselect

  augroup my_cm_setup
    autocmd!
    autocmd BufEnter * call ncm2#enable_for_buffer()
    autocmd Filetype tex call ncm2#register_source({
            \ 'name': 'vimtex',
            \ 'priority': 8,
            \ 'scope': ['tex'],
            \ 'mark': 'tex',
            \ 'word_pattern': '\w+',
            \ 'complete_pattern': g:vimtex#re#ncm2,
            \ 'on_complete': ['ncm2#on_complete#omni', 'vimtex#complete#omnifunc'],
            \ })
  augroup END
<
For more lenient, omni-complete-like, filtering of completion candidates,
use the following setup (in your init.vim or a personal ftplugin) instead: >

  augroup my_cm_setup
    autocmd!
    autocmd BufEnter * call ncm2#enable_for_buffer()
    autocmd Filetype tex call ncm2#register_source({

nvim-completion-manager~
                                                          *vimtex-complete-ncm*
Note: |nvim-completion-manager| has been replaced by |ncm2|, and users are
recommended to change. See |vimtex-complete-ncm2| for hints on how to setup
|ncm2| for vimtex.

|nvim-completion-manager| is a fast, extensible, async completion framework
for neovim (and Vim version 8.0 and above).  The project is available here:
https://github.com/roxma/nvim-completion-manager

To configure for vimtex, one can use the following code: >

  augroup my_cm_setup
    autocmd!
    autocmd User CmSetup call cm#register_source({
          \ 'name' : 'vimtex',
          \ 'priority': 8,

  augroup END

YouCompleteMe~
                                                *vimtex-complete-youcompleteme*
|youcompleteme| is probably the most popular code-completion engine for Vim.  The
github repository is here: https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe.
It is described as:

> YouCompleteMe is a fast, as-you-type, fuzzy-search code completion engine
> for Vim. It has several completion engines: an identifier-based engine that
> works with every programming language, a semantic, Clang [3]-based engine
> that provides native semantic code completion for the C-family languages,
> a Jedi [4]-based completion engine for Python, an OmniSharp [5]-based
> completion engine for C# and an omnifunc-based completer that uses data from
> Vim's omnicomplete system to provide semantic completions for many other
> languages (Ruby, PHP etc.).

To enable automatic completion with |youcompleteme|, use the following options: >

  if !exists('g:ycm_semantic_triggers')
    let g:ycm_semantic_triggers = {}
  endif
  au VimEnter * let g:ycm_semantic_triggers.tex=g:vimtex#re#youcompleteme

VimCompletesMe~

A plugin that maps <tab> to trigger the built-in completion that is most
suitable to the current contex.  The plugin is available here:
https://github.com/ajh17/VimCompletesMe.

The following options may be used to enable completion with the <tab> trigger
for LaTeX documents with |VimCompletesMe| and |vimtex|s omni completion function: >

  augroup VimCompletesMeTex

FOLDING                                                        *vimtex-folding*

|vimtex| can fold documents according to the LaTeX structure (part, chapter,
section and subsection).  Folding is turned off by default, but it can be
enabled if desired, either through the option |g:vimtex_fold_enabled|, or
manually with >

  set foldmethod=expr
  set foldexpr=vimtex#fold#level(v:lnum)
  set foldtext=vimtex#fold#text()

The folding is mainly configured through the dictionary option
|g:vimtex_fold_types|.

Note: The |fold-expr| method of folding is well known to be slow, e.g. for
      long lines and large files. To speed things up, the user may want to
      enable the |g:vimtex_fold_manual| option. An alternative is to add
      a dedicated plugin that improves folding speed for the slow fold
      methods, e.g. https://github.com/Konfekt/FastFold.

In order to get slightly cleaner fold text, I recommend setting the global
'fillchars' option to a single space for folds: >

  set fillchars=fold:\

Note: Remember to include the whitespace after backslash!

Associated settings:
  |g:vimtex_fold_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_fold_manual|
  |g:vimtex_fold_levelmarker|
  |g:vimtex_fold_types|
  |g:vimtex_fold_types_defaults|

==============================================================================
INDENTATION                                                     *vimtex-indent*
                                                            *vimtex-bib-indent*

|vimtex| provides custom indentation functions both for LaTeX documents and
for bibliography files (`.bib` files).

Associated settings:
  |g:vimtex_indent_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_indent_bib_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_indent_delims|
  |g:vimtex_indent_ignored_envs|
  |g:vimtex_indent_lists|

==============================================================================
SYNTAX HIGHLIGHTING                                             *vimtex-syntax*

Vim ships with syntax highlighting for LaTeX documents out of the box, please
see |ft-tex-syntax|.  |vimtex| therefore does not provide its own syntax
highlighting.  However, |vimtex| does add some minor improvements:

- Support for `biblatex` and `natbib` package
- Support for `cleveref` package
- Improved highlighting of `listings` package
- Nested syntax highlighting for `dot2tex`, `lualatex`, `gnuplottex`,
  `asymptote`, `pythontex`, `listings`, and `minted`

Before enabling additional syntax highlighting, |vimtex| also checks the
|g:tex_fast| variable (defined by |ft-tex-syntax|) that allows one to
selectively enable or disable highlighting for specific groups.  If
|g:tex_fast| is set, additional syntax highlighting for bold, italic, and
reference groups are enabled only if they are explicitly allowed.

Note: The default syntax highlighting of vim maintained by Charles Campbell
      does not support any package (:h tex-package). However, C. Campbell
      provides syntax highlighting files on his website for
      - `amsmath`
      - `array`
      - `lstlisting`
      - `moreverb`
      - `slide`
      http://www.drchip.org/astronaut/vim/index.html#LATEXPKGS

Note: For people that are interested in improved conceal support, please check
      out Keita Nakamura's plugin tex-conceal.vim:
      https://github.com/KeitaNakamura/tex-conceal.vim

Associated settings:
  |g:vimtex_syntax_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_syntax_nested|

==============================================================================
NAVIGATION                                                  *vimtex-navigation*

Vim already has a lot of useful navigation related features, such as
|tags-and-searches| and |include-search|. |vimtex| improves the latter feature
by setting the 'include' and 'includeexpr' options, see |vimtex-includeexpr|.

|vimtex| also provides a separate table-of-content feature. This works by
parsing the LaTeX project and displaying a table of contents in a separate
window. For more info, see |vimtex-toc|.

The "engine" for collecting the table-of-content entries may also be used as
a backend for external plugins. There are sources for |denite.nvim|, |unite.vim|
and |fzf.vim| that should work well. The source code may be used as inspiration
to write custom sources or sources for other, similar plugins.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
INCLUDE EXPRESSION                                         *vimtex-includeexpr*

|vimtex| provides an advanced |includeexpr| that makes it possible to open
source files for e.g. packages and documentclasses with the |gf| command. The
implementation relies on `kpsewhich` to find the source files. Consider the
following example: >

  \documentclass{article}
  \usepackage{MyLocalPackage}
  \usepackage{SomeOtherPackage,YetAnotherPackage}
  ...

With the cursor on the documentclass name `article` or one of the package
names, |gf| will take you to the TeX source files (typically `.cls` file for
documentclass and `.sty` files for packages).

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TABLE OF CONTENTS                                                  *vimtex-toc*

|vimtex-toc| displays a table of contents (ToC) for the current LaTeX document.
The ToC entries may be activated/jumped to with <cr> or <space>. There are
currently four different "layers" of entries:

- content  This is the main part and the "real" ToC
- todo     This shows TODOs from comments and `\todo{...}` commands
- label    This shows `\label{...}` commands
- include  This shows included files

The ToC is configured with |g:vimtex_toc_config|. One may change things from
where the ToC window is positioned to which layers to show and more. Please
read the option help for details.

The ToC parser uses a list of matchers to parse the LaTeX project for the ToC
entries. One may add custom matchers through the |g:vimtex_toc_custom_matchers|
option. The syntax of a custom matcher is specified here:
|toc_matcher_specification|.

Note: By setting the `mode` configuration key to > 2, the separate ToC window
is not opened and most of the features mentioned here will be irrelevant.

One may force file input entries of the "include" type into the ToC through
comments with the following syntax: >

  % vimtex-include: /path/to/file

The path may be absolute or relative. In the latter case, it will be relative
to the current root (as printed by |:VimtexInfo|). This will add an entry in
the ToC which makes it easy to open any file. Any file opened through the ToC
that was included in this manner will be linked to the current vimtex project,
and thus the ToC and similar commands will be available, even if the file is
not a LaTeX file.

                                                       *vimtex-toc-custom-maps*
Some people may want to have separate mappings for different ToC contents,
e.g. one mapping to open a table of labels and todos and a different mapping
to open a table of include files. This may be easily added with custom
mappings: >

  augroup vimtex_customization
    autocmd!
    autocmd FileType tex call CreateTocs()
  augroup END

  function CreateTocs()
    let g:custom_toc1 = vimtex#toc#new({
        \ 'layers' : ['label', 'todo'],
        \ 'todo_sorted' : 0,
        \ 'show_help' : 0,
        \ 'show_numbers' : 0,
        \ 'mode' : 4,
        \})
    nnoremap <silent> \ly :call g:custom_toc1.open()<cr>

    let g:custom_toc2 = vimtex#toc#new({
        \ 'layers' : ['include'],
        \ 'show_help' : 0,
        \})
    nnoremap <silent> \lY :call g:custom_toc2.open()<cr>
  endfunction

The `vimtex#toc#new` function takes a dictionary argument that may be used to
override the one main configuration (i.e. the combination of the default
values and |g:vimtex_toc_config|).

Associated settings:
  |g:vimtex_toc_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_toc_custom_matchers|
  |g:vimtex_toc_todo_keywords|
  |g:vimtex_toc_show_preamble|
  |g:vimtex_toc_config|

DENITE AND UNITE SOURCES                                        *vimtex-denite*
                                                                 *vimtex-unite*

                                        https://github.com/Shougo/denite.nvim
                                          https://github.com/Shougo/unite.vim
|denite.nvim| is is a popular interface for many things, including outlines.
Although |vimtex| includes a simple interface for a tables of contents, it also
makes sense to provide these as a source to |denite.nvim|. The source name is
simply `vimtex`.

|unite.vim| is the predecessor to |denite.nvim|. As for denite, there is a source
called `vimtex`.

If one prefers the |denite.nvim| or |unite.vim| source to the |vimtex| interface,
one may override the default mapping, e.g.: >

  nnoremap <localleader>lt :<c-u>Denite vimtex<cr>
  nnoremap <localleader>lt :<c-u>Unite vimtex<cr>

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FZF INTEGRATION                                                   *vimtex-fzf*

                                           https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim
                                               https://github.com/junegunn/fzf
|fzf.vim| integrates the general-purpose command-line fuzzy finder |fzf| into vim
and neovim. Similar to the |denite.vim| and |unite.vim| source it may be used to
quickly navigate |vimtex|'s built-in ToC feature. To use it, just define a
mapping to `vimtex#fzf#run()` in your .vimrc, e.g.: >

  nnoremap <localleader>lt :call vimtex#fzf#run()<cr>

You can also choose to only show certain entry "layers", according to this
table (see |vimtex-toc| for detailed explanation of the "layers"):

  `c`:  content
  `t`:  todo
  `l`:  label
  `i`:  include

The default behavior is to show all layers, i.e. 'ctli'. To only show
`content` and `label`s use: >

  :call vimtex#fzf#run('ct')

On Windows the python package Colorama is required for colored output.
For Linux and MacOS colors should work out-of-the-box, even without Colorama.

==============================================================================
COMPILER                                                      *vimtex-compiler*

|vimtex| provides an interface to the following LaTeX compilers/compiler
backends:

  |vimtex-latexmk|   http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc
  |vimtex-latexrun|  https://github.com/aclements/latexrun
  |vimtex-tectonic|  https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/
  |vimtex-arara|     https://github.com/cereda/arara

The interface is implemented in a general way, which makes it relatively easy
to add new compilers.

Compilation is started and stopped with |VimtexCompile| and |VimtexStop|.
Although, |VimtexStop| stopping is only relevant for continuous compilations,
and in this case, |VimtexCompile| itself works as a toggle.  Single shot
compilation is always available through |VimtexCompileSS|.  The default
mappings for these commands are listed here: |vimtex-default-mappings|.

It is also possible to compile a selection of the file. To do this, one may
either use the mapping, |<plug>(vimtex-compile-selected)|, or the command
|VimtexCompileSelected|. This will compile the selected text by copying it to
a temporary file with the same preamble as the current file. It will be
compiled similarly to a single shot compile, and if there are errors, they
will be shown in the quickfix list.

The compilers should respect the TeX program directive as described here:
|vimtex-tex-program|, except for |vimtex-arara|, which uses its own set of
directives and rules.

Associated commands:
  |VimtexCompile|
  |VimtexCompileSS|
  |VimtexCompileSS!|
  |VimtexCompileSelected|
  |VimtexCompileOutput|
  |VimtexStatus|
  |VimtexStatus!|
  |VimtexStop|
  |VimtexStopAll|
  |VimtexErrors|
  |VimtexErrors|
  |VimtexClean|
  |VimtexClean!|
  |VimtexErrors|

LATEXMK                                                        *vimtex-latexmk*

                      http://users.phys.psu.edu/~collins/software/latexmk-jcc
> latexmk is a perl script for running LaTeX the correct number of times to
> resolve cross references, etc; it also runs auxiliary programs (bibtex,
> makeindex if necessary, and dvips and/or a previewer as requested).  It has
> a number of other useful capabilities, for example to start a previewer and

`latexmk` is a compiler backend that handles recompilation of LaTeX documents
when source files have been changed.  |vimtex| uses the continuous mode by
default, but `latexmk` also allows single shot compilations.  The compiler may
be configured through the |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| option.

If you use |nvim| or Vim with |+job| or |+clientserver|, and if the `callback`
key is enabled (which it is by default), then compilation errors will be
parsed automatically.  This is done by utilizing the tricks explained below.
Note: This only works for continuous compilation mode.

As stated, one may customize the `latexmk` options through
|g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk|.  However, one may also configure `latexmk`
explicitly through a global `~/.latexmkrc` file, or a project specific
`.latexmkrc` file. It is important to know that command line arguments have
priority, so one may want to use custom options if one wants to specify
particular things in a configuration file.

A particular set of options are very convenient for a good coupling between
`latexmk` and Vim: `$compiling_cmd`, `$success_cmd`, and `$failure_cmd`.  These options
can be used to specify commands that are run by `latexmk` before and after
compilation.  This is used by |vimtex| to achieve callbacks after compilation
has finished with something like this: >

  $success_cmd = "gvim --remote-expr 'vimtex#compiler#callback(1)'";
  $failure_cmd = "gvim --remote-expr 'vimtex#compiler#callback(0)'";

Another neat way to use this is to use `xdotool` to change the window title of
the viewer to indicate the compilation status: >

  $compiling_cmd = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" " .
                   "set_window --name \"%D compiling...\"";
  $success_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" " .
                   "set_window --name \"%D OK\"";
  $failure_cmd   = "xdotool search --name \"%D\" " .
                   "set_window --name \"%D FAILURE\"";

Note: If you define these options similar to the above `xdotool` trick and
      still want to enable the |vimtex| callbacks, then one must include
      a semicolon at the end of the `cmd` strings so that |vimtex| may append
      safely to the options.

Note: More info on `xdotool` here: http://www.semicomplete.com/projects/xdotool.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
LATEXRUN                                                      *vimtex-latexrun*

                                        https://github.com/aclements/latexrun
> See LaTeX run. Run latexrun.
>

`latexrun` is a compiler backend that handles recompilation of LaTeX documents
when source files have been changed.  However, it is a much simpler backend,
and does not support e.g. continuous mode and automatic starting of viewers.
The latter is supported by vimtex, though, through the callback.  See
|g:vimtex_view_automatic|.

The compiler may be configured through the |g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun| option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TECTONIC                                                      *vimtex-tectonic*

                                      https://tectonic-typesetting.github.io/
> Tectonic is a modernized, complete, self-contained TeX/LaTeX engine, powered
> by XeTeX and TeXLive.

`tectonic` is a compiler backend that features automatic support file
downloading along with reproduceable builds and full Unicode and OpenType
fonts support thanks to the power of XeTeX. It does not support continuous
compilation, like |vimtex-latexmk| and so the only relevant commands are
|VimtexCompile| to start (single shot) compilation, and |VimtexCompileOutput|
to see the compilation output. As for |vimtex-latexrun| and |vimtex-arara|,
the viewer can be started automatically with |g:vimtex_view_automatic|.

`tectonic` cleans up intermediate files like `.aux` and log files by default.
However, |vimtex|'s backend invoke it with the flags `--keep-logs` and
`--keep-synctex` which enables us to see the errors on the quickfix and it
gives us synctex support. Therefor, by default, |<plug>(vimtex-clean)|
and |VimtexClean| clean these files.

The compiler may be configured through the |g:vimtex_compiler_tectonic| option.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ARARA                                                            *vimtex-arara*

                                        https://github.com/cereda/arara
> arara is a TeX automation tool based on rules and directives. It gives you
> subsidies to enhance your TeX experience.

`arara` is a TeX automation tool that uses rules and directives that are
defined in the preamble of a LaTeX project. The user manual can be found here:
http://ctan.uib.no/support/arara/doc/arara-usermanual.pdf

`arara` does not do continuous compilation, and so the only relevant commands
are |VimtexCompile| to start (single shot) compilation, and
|VimtexCompileOutput| to see the compilation output. As for |vimtex-latexrun|
and |vimtex-tectonic|, the viewer can be started automatically with
|g:vimtex_view_automatic|.

The compiler may be configured through the |g:vimtex_compiler_arara| option.

==============================================================================
VIEW                                                              *vimtex-view*

|vimtex| provides the command |VimtexView| to open the desired viewer.  The
command is mapped to '<localleader>lv' by default.  The list of supported
viewers are given in the description of |g:vimtex_view_method|.

For supported viewers, |VimtexView| will also perform forward search when the
viewer is opened.

Associated settings:
  |g:vimtex_view_enabled|
  |g:vimtex_view_automatic|
  |g:vimtex_view_method|
  |g:vimtex_view_use_temp_files|
  |g:vimtex_view_general_viewer|
  |g:vimtex_view_<viewer>_options|

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SYNCTEX SUPPORT                                                *vimtex-synctex*

Synctex is a tool that enables synchronization of the text editor position and
the pdf viewer position.  The tool may be used to add mappings in vim to go to
the current position in the compiled pdf document (forward search), and also
to go from a specific position in the pdf file to the corresponding position
in vim (inverse/backward search).

To make synctex work, it must be enabled. vimtex enables this by default by
passing `-synctex=1` on the command line, unless the user overrides the
option (see the `option` key for |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| or
|g:vimtex_compiler_latexrun|).

Alternatively, for |vimtex-latexmk|, one can put this in ones `~/.latexmkrc` file: >

  $pdflatex = 'pdflatex -synctex=1 %O %S';

Note: For |neovim| users, one must use `neovim-remote` (see link below) for
      backward search. This is done by installing `neovim-remote` and setting
      |g:vimtex_compiler_progname| to `'nvr'`
      https://github.com/mhinz/neovim-remote

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FORWARD SEARCH                                  *vimtex-synctex-forward-search*

For supported viewers, |VimtexView| (<localleader>lv) will issue a forward
search if the viewer is already opened.  The forward search will take you to
the page or position in the viewer that corresponds to the current line in
your vim session.  See |g:vimtex_view_method| for a list of supported viewers.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BACKWARD SEARCH                                *vimtex-synctex-backward-search*
                                                *vimtex-synctex-inverse-search*

In supported viewers one may set up backward or inverse search.  When
correctly set up, this allows one to go directly from a selected line in the
viewer (typically by double clicking with the mouse or something similar) to
the corresponding line inside the Vim instance.

Backward search is typically set up inside the specific viewer through an
option named something like "inverse search command-line".  A standard value
for the option is: >

  gvim --remote-silent +%l "%f"

Note: Inverse search relies on the |clientserver| functionality of vim.  Each
      instance of vim runs its own server.  The above mentioned standard value
      implies the default server name, which might not be the actual name of
      the server for the vim instance you are using.

Note: For backward search to work on windows, one must ensure that the folder
      that contains `gVim.exe` is in your `%PATH%` environment variable.

==============================================================================
LATEX DOCUMENTATION                                           *vimtex-latexdoc*

|vimtex| provides the command |VimtexDocPackage| to open documentation for
packages and documentclasses. The command is mapped to `K` by default, and by
default package documentation is looked up through http://texdoc.net/. This
can be customized through |g:vimtex_doc_handler|.

In the following, I list some alternative and relevant options for access to
LaTeX documentation, both online and offline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ONLINE                                                 *vimtex-latexdoc-online*

I recommend the LaTeX Wikibook [0] as a good source of documentation for
LaTeX. One should also know about the Comprehensive TeX Archive Network, or
CTAN [1], which is the central place for all kinds of material around TeX.
The long-existing unofficial LaTeX(2e) reference manual (latexref) can be
found online at [2].

[0]: https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX
[1]: https://ctan.org/
[2]: https://latexref.xyz/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OFFLINE                                               *vimtex-latexdoc-offline*

One may use a more dedicated offline documentation system. On OSX, Dash [0] is
a non-free but high-quality system. On Linux, one may use Zeal [1] or dasht
[2], both of which access the Dash documentation sets. Zeal should also work
well on Windows.

The above systems may be accessed from vim through dash.vim [3], zeavim.vim
[4] or vim-dasht [5], respectively. Other alternative vim plugins include
investigate.vim [6].

A different option is to rely on texdoc [7]. If you specify e.g. in your
`~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex.vim` to use `setlocal keywordprg=texdoc`, then
press |K| on a package name in `\usepackage{name}`, this will open the
documentation pdf of this package. Note, though, that this assumes that the
documentation is available offline, which it might not be (e.g. on Arch Linux
it is not available through the texlive packages).

The unofficial LaTeX(2e) reference manual (latexref) should also be mentioned,
since it may be easily downloaded in various formats from [8].

CODE STRUCTURE                                                    *vimtex-code*

The |vimtex| code is based on the |autoload| feature of vim. For each new
latex buffer, the function *vimtex#init* initializes a state variable as well
as buffer local mappings and commands, all based on the desired options (see
|vimtex-options|).

The main init function calls `vimtex#mymodule#init_buffer` for each submodule,
if it exists. This function should take care of defining buffer local
mappings, commands, and autocommands.

The state variable is a |Dictionary| that contains data that is specific to
a single LaTeX project. Such a project may consist of several buffers for
different files if the project is a multi-file project (see
|vimtex-multi-file|). A submodule may add to the state during initialization
with `vimtex#mymodule#init_state`, which takes the state object as a single
argument.

The command |VimtexInfo| (mapped to <localleader>li by default) will show the
(relevant) contents of the local state, as well as some auxiliary information
that may be useful for debugging purposes.

FAQ                                                                *vimtex-faq*

                                                   *vimtex-faq-slow-matchparen*
Q: Why is matching parens so slow?
A: Because it is complicated and requires some expensive searches for matching
   parantheses. It uses the syntax information to skip commented delimiters,
   which is expensive. You can tune the timeout and stopline parameters for
   the searches with |g:vimtex_delim_timeout| and |g:vimtex_delim_stopline|,
   which may help. If it is still too slow, you can also try to use
   vim-matchup [0].

Q: How do I properly set up vimtex with Skim?
A: First, set |g:vimtex_view_method| to `skim` (see also some relevant info at
   |vimtex_viewer_skim|). This should already enable forward search. To get
   backward search, open the settings panel in Skim, then go to the Sync tab
   and create a custom preset for `PDF-TeX Sync support`. Use the following
   settings: >

     Command: /Applications/MacVim.app/Contents/bin/mvim
     Args:    --remote-silent +"%line" "%file"
<
   Note: This assumes that you are using MacVim. Ensure that the `Command` path
         is correct, e.g. by checking with `which mvim` in your shell.

   Note: If you have multiple versions of Vim installed (e.g. default Vim, and
         one or more versions of MacVim), then make sure that you are
         consistent in which version of Vim you are running!

Q: |vimtex| provides `dse`, `dsc`, `cse`, and `csc`.  These seem to be inspired by
   |surround.vim|.  Does |vimtex| also provide the corresponding `yse` and `ysc`?
A: The mentioned mappings are indeed inspired by |surround.vim|.  However,
   |vimtex| does not provide `ys<text-object>e` and `ys<text-object>c`.  If you use
   |surround.vim|, then the asked for mappings may be easily added if one adds
   the following lines to `~/.vim/after/ftplugin/tex.vim` or any other
   `ftplugin/tex.vim` in your |runtimepath|: >

   Note: An alternative is to use `vim-sandwich` (see |sandwich.txt| or
         https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich), which has built-in
         support for LaTeX-specific surroundings.

                                                         *vimtex-faq-isfname*
Q: Vim throws error when jumping to file with |gf|.
A: This might be due to the |isfname| setting, which by default contains `{,}`
 on windows.  |isfname| is a global option, and can therefore not be set by
 `vimtex`.  Suggested solution is to remove `{,}` from |isfname| by: >

  set isfname-={,}

                                                            *vimtex-faq-neovim*
Q: Does |vimtex| work with neovim?
A: Yes. Since 2018-11-18 [0], most features work out of the box. However, for
   backward search from PDF viewer to neovim, one needs the `neovim-remote`
   tool as described below.

   `Deprecated`: The compiler coupling and some of the viewer functionality
   require the |--remote| options from the |clientserver|. For some reason,
   these options have been removed from neovim, see #1750 [1]. There does
   remain some hope that the options will be reimplemented sometime in the
   future.

   In the meantime, there exists a workaround: `neovim-remote` [2] is a simple
   tool that implements the |--remote| options through a python script. If one
   downloads this tool and sets the option |g:vimtex_compiler_progname| to
   `nvr` (or the full path, if `nvr` is not in `$PATH`), then everything
   should work.

Q: How can I jump from a `\ref{label}` to the corresponding label?
A: This is not a feature provided by |vimtex| itself, but vim has very good
   support for tag navigation, see |tags-and-searches|. It is worth mentioning
   that the |ctags| support for LaTeX is somewhat lacking. This can be amended
   by adding some lines to your `~/.ctags` configuration file (or
   `.ctags.d/default.ctags` if you use Universal ctags), e.g.: >

    --langdef=tex2
    --langmap=tex2:.tex
    --regex-tex2=/\\label[ \t]*\*?\{[ \t]*([^}]*)\}/\1/l,label/

<   See [0,1] for references. I also find |gutentags| [2] to be very convenient
   for automatically generating and updating tag files.

Q: How can I jump from a `\cite{key}` to the corresponding bibtex entry?
A: This is not a feature provided by |vimtex| itself. Similar to
   |vimtex-faq-tags|, the feature is available through |tags-and-searches|.
   The following `~/.ctags` configuration will be useful (or
   `.ctags.d/default.ctags` if you use Universal ctags): >

    --langdef=bib

                                                         *vimtex-faq-texmfhome*
Q: How can I change `TEXMFHOME`?
A: If you change `TEXMFHOME` in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` or similar and use `gvim`
   invoked from the desktop environment (from menus, hotkeys, etc.), gvim does
   not know about the new value of `TEXMFHOME`. The reason for this is that
   `vim` invokes shells (e.g. with `!` or `system()`) as non-interactive and
   non-login shell, which means `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` are not read.  If you
   start `gvim` from an interactive shell which has read `.bashrc` or `.zshrc,
   `gvim` inherits these values and therefore they are consistent.

   One can make the invoked shells interactive by setting |shellcmdflag| to
   "-ic".  If you want to keep them non-interactive, you can create an
   additional shell startup file where you keep your environment variables:

   1. If bash is your default shell, create e.g. the file `.bashenv` containing
      your customized `TEXMFHOME` variable and add `$BASH_ENV=$HOME/.bashenv` to
      `$MYVIMRC` and `source $HOME/.bashenv` to `.bashrc` [0].

   2. If zsh is your default shell, use `.zshenv` for customizing `TEXMFHOME`.
      This file is always read by zsh. Nothing has to be added to `$MYVIMRC` [1].

   For more information on how to correctly set environment variables, see e.g.
   the SO answer by @Rmano [2].

Q: Does vimtex support Windows?
A: Yes and no.  I personally don't use Windows, and as such, it is difficult
   to make every feature work perfectly.  However, I think most features
   should work.  Here are some things that might not work quite as expected,
   with some workarounds.

   * The full executable path for `gvim.exe` might include spaces, which might
     lead to problems, see e.g. [0].  A workaround is to put the default
     installation path of Vim (or neovim) to your %PATH% variable and set
     |g:vimtex_compiler_progname| to |v:progname|. See [3] for a convenient
     tool to adapt %PATH%.

   * Vimtex does not work well with the 'shell' setting set to Windows
     PowerShell. It is therefore recommended to use the default 'shell'
     settings. See [4] for more information.

   Also, see [1-2] for some relevant issues that might be of interest.

TROUBLESHOOTING                                       *vimtex-troubleshooting*

Here are some pitfalls that one may experience if one of these assumptions are
broken:

- Completion may not work properly for exotic file encodings, such as for
  UTF-16LE (see https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/615)

With different operating systems and different plugin configurations, there
are a few things that must be considered for system interoperability. A number
of common problems and suggested solutions are included in the following
troubleshooting section.

Problem: The user wants to use vim-polyglot~

This is a problem, because vim-polyglot [0] includes and enables LaTeX-Box by
default. LaTeX-Box will not work well with vimtex, e.g. because of conflicting
mappings. There are two solutions.

Solution 1: Avoid vim-polyglot. This is recommended, because vim-polyglot
  installs a bunch of filetype plugins that you will not use anyway. Further,
  one should aim to know which plugins are installed in ones system. It is not
  a lot of extra work to install whichever extra filetype plugins one need.

Solution 2: If one insists on using vim-polyglot, then one may use
  |g:polyglot_disabled| to disable LaTeX-Box with: >

  let g:polyglot_disabled = ['latex']

[0]: https://github.com/sheerun/vim-polyglot

Problem: Continuous compilation seems to hang~

Upon starting continuous compilation the status bar indicates "vimtex:
Compiler started in continuous mode", but the compilation never terminates and
the quickfix window does not load.

Tips:
1. Ensure that a latexmk process and a Perl process have started. If they have
   not been started, then these two programs may not accessible given your
   operating system's PATH environment variable.
2. On Windows, some releases of Perl have been known to not trigger callbacks
   upon successful/failed compilation. It is highly suggested to install a
   dedicated Perl distribution (e.g. Strawberry Perl). See
   https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/378 for more information.
3. Ensure that the option `-interaction=nonstopmode` is provided to latexmk.
   This is done by default by vimtex, unless the user provides custom options
   through |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk| (see the `option` key). In the latter
   case, the user must ensure that the said option is also provided.

Problem: Text objects on Windows~

In Windows, environment text object commands, like `vae` and `vie`, do not
select the entire body of the environment. More specifically, given: >

    \begin{someenv}
      some content
    \end{someenv}

The command `dae` results in: >

    }

and `die` results in: >

    \begin{someenv}
      t
    \end{someenv}

Solution: It seems that vim for Windows comes with some options set by default
in the vimrc file. One of these has been reported to be `:behave mswin` (see
|:behave|) which, among other things, sets the 'selection' option to
"exclusive". This can be ameliorated by pursuing one of two options:

  1) Add `:behave xterm` to your vimrc file.
  2) Add `:set selection=inclusive` to your vimrc file.

See also: https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/408

Problem: Typing <Tab> or <C-n> causes Vim to hang before making a completion~

Vimtex may be scanning included files with `kpsewhich` while collecting
completion candidates for keyword completion. Try disabling this feature by
setting |g:vimtex_include_search_enabled| to 0 in your |vimrc|: >

    let g:vimtex_include_search_enabled = 0

Note: Plugins like |supertab| [0], which often maps the |i_<Tab>| key, will
      typically use keyword completion "behind the scenes" to gather
      completion candidates.

CHANGELOG                                                    *vimtex-changelog*

The following changelog only logs particularly important changes, such as
changes that break backwards compatibility.  See the git log for the detailed
changelog.

2018-08-15: Refactored the ToC interface~
I've made a large update to the code for the ToC window in order to simplify
and unify the interface. In the new version, |g:vimtex_toc_config| replaces
all of the following options:

  *g:vimtex_index_split_width*
  *g:vimtex_index_split_pos*
  *g:vimtex_index_show_help*
  *g:vimtex_index_resize*
  *g:vimtex_index_hide_line_numbers*
  *g:vimtex_index_mode*
  *g:vimtex_toc_layers*
  *g:vimtex_toc_fold*
  *g:vimtex_toc_fold_level_start*
  *g:vimtex_toc_hotkeys*
  *g:vimtex_toc_refresh_always*
  *g:vimtex_toc_show_numbers*
  *g:vimtex_toc_tocdepth*


2017-07-27: Major refactoring of the folding feature~
I've made a large update to the code for folding. The configuration of the
various folded elements is now done through a single option:
|g:vimtex_fold_types|.

Deprecated options:
  *g:vimtex_fold_comments*
  *g:vimtex_fold_preamble*
  *g:vimtex_fold_envs*
  *g:vimtex_fold_env_blacklist*
  *g:vimtex_fold_env_whitelist*
  *g:vimtex_fold_markers*
  *g:vimtex_fold_parts*
  *g:vimtex_fold_sections*
  *g:vimtex_fold_commands*
  *g:vimtex_fold_commands_default*

                                                               *vimtex-lacheck*
2017-06-05: Removed Lacheck support~
Removed support for using `lacheck` for checking LaTeX syntax. The reason is
that there exist several (good) external plugins for syntax checking files.
These are general purpose plugins that work for multiple file types. For more
info, see |vimtex-non-features|.

2017-05-20: Updated TOC options~
There's been a few updates to the TOC. During this work, I removed some
unecessary options.

Deprecated options:
  *g:vimtex_toc_fold_levels*  (was not necessary)
  *g:vimtex_toc_number_width*  (see |g:vimtex_toc_tocdepth|)

2017-03-31: Refactored quickfix related features~
I've added a more general layer for handling different error parsers.
Currently there are few or now changes from the user point of view, but this
should make it possible to add other methods for showing errors in a LaTeX
project than the current one that parses the `.log` file directly.

Deprecated options:
  *g:vimtex_quickfix_warnings*  (see |g:vimtex_quickfix_latexlog|)

2017-03-28: Major refactoring of initialization~
Added a general compiler interface, see |vimtex-compiler|.  To configure the
`latexmk` compiler, see |g:vimtex_compiler_latexmk|.

Deprecated options:
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_enabled* (use |g:vimtex_compiler_enabled|)
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_progname* (use |g:vimtex_compiler_progname|)
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_callback_hooks* (use |g:vimtex_compiler_callback_hooks|)
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_callback*
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_autojump*
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_continuous*
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_background*
  *g:vimtex_latexmk_options*

Deprecated commands:
  *VimtexCompileToggle* (use |VimtexCompile|)

2017-03-28: Major refactoring of initialization~
The initialization has been refactored in order to provide a more consistent
separation of buffer initialization and state initialization. This has no
major consequence for users, but it makes maintenance and further development
easier.

2017-03-02: Changed how to set ignored warnings~
I'm updating the changelog to notify of a change to the quickfix settings.

Deprecated options:
  *g:vimtex_quickfix_ignore_all_warnings*
  *g:vimtex_quickfix_ignored_warnings*

See instead:
  |g:vimtex_quickfix_warnings|

2016-05-31: A lot of things have updated~
I know that people would like to see a simple list of changes. Unfortunately,
I am bad at keeping this changelog updated. All details are available in the
git log, though. The reason I added this entry is to note that I have removed
an option:

  *g:vimtex_env_complete_list* --- It is no longer necessary. Completion
                                 candidates are instead parsed from the
                                 project.

2016-02-06: Large refactoring of delimiter parsing~
I've refactored a lot of the code in order to make the parsing of delimiters
and features that rely on delimiter detection and similar more consistent.
This results in some changes in option names and similar, but it should make
it easier to provide improved and more robust features.

There is one feature change: The delimiter toggle now consistently toggles the
modifier, not the delimiter itself, and it toggles between a range of
modifiers by default. For customization, see |g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list|.

The following options have changed names:
  *g:vimtex_change_set_formatexpr* ---> |g:vimtex_format_enabled|
  *g:vimtex_change_complete_envs*  ---> |g:vimtex_env_complete_list|
  *g:vimtex_change_toggled_delims* ---> |g:vimtex_delim_toggle_mod_list|

The following options have been removed:
  *g:vimtex_change_ignored_delims_pattern* --- It was no longer necessary

The following mappings have been renamed:
  *<plug>(vimtex-delete-env)*   ---> |<plug>(vimtex-env-delete)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-delete-cmd)*   ---> |<plug>(vimtex-cmd-delete)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-change-env)*   ---> |<plug>(vimtex-env-change)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-change-cmd)*   ---> |<plug>(vimtex-cmd-change)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-toggle-star)*  ---> |<plug>(vimtex-env-toggle-star)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-toggle-delim)* ---> |<plug>(vimtex-delim-toggle-modifier)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-create-cmd)*   ---> |<plug>(vimtex-cmd-create)|
  *<plug>(vimtex-close-env)*    ---> |<plug>(vimtex-delim-close)|

2015-10-19: Added convenient insert mode mappings~
I've merged the `math_mappings` branch (see #172 and #251). It adds the
feature that is explained in |vimtex-imaps|.

2015-06-06: Minor but convenient restructuring (++)~
I've changed a lot of the code structure in relatively small ways.  For
instance, instead of referring to the particular data blobs through the global
array, I instead linked a buffer variable to the correct global array element.

One particular change is that all modules are now initialized in three steps:

  1. Initialize module options
  2. Initialize script variables and single execution functionalities
  3. Initialize buffer options

Finally, I've cleaned up a lot of the code by removing some deprecation
warnings and similar.

2015-03-21: Implemented index buffers, deprecated vimtex_toc filetype~
The system for displaying the table of content relied on a dedicated filetype
plugin.  This was inherited from LaTeX-Box, and worked quite well.  However,
I intend to implement more functionality that uses the same kind of buffer to
display similar things, such as a list of labels.  I realized I wanted the ToC
window to be more adaptable, so I implemented the `index` interface for such
buffers.  The `index` in itself may be used to create ToC-like buffers with
simple actions.  The |vimtex-toc| uses and expands the `index` in such a way
that the changes should barely be noticeable from the user perspective.  Note
however the following variable name changes:

  *g:vimtex_toc_numbers_width*     ---> |g:vimtex_toc_number_width|
  *g:vimtex_toc_hide_preamble*     ---> |g:vimtex_toc_show_preamble|
  *g:vimtex_toc_numbers*           ---> |g:vimtex_toc_show_numbers|

  *g:vimtex_toc_hide_line_numbers* ---> |g:vimtex_index_hide_line_numbers|
  *g:vimtex_toc_resize*            ---> |g:vimtex_index_resize|
  *g:vimtex_toc_hide_help*         ---> |g:vimtex_index_show_help|
  *g:vimtex_toc_split_pos*         ---> |g:vimtex_index_split|
  *g:vimtex_toc_width*             -/

                                                         *vim-latex-namechange*
2015-03-08: Changed the name to vimtex~
The old name `vim-latex` was already used by LaTeX-Suite.  I was not aware of
the name clash in the beginning.  Due to the rising popularity of this plugin,
it has become clear that such a name clash is very inconvenient.  The present
change is therefore very much needed.

The name change is reflected throughout the plugin in the names of commands,
mappings, functions, and options.  People should update their `vimrc` settings
accordingly.  For instance, every option name should be changed from >

  g:latex_... = ...

to >

  g:vimtex_... = ...

2014-12-07: Added more general view functionality~
Added new module for view functionality.  This allows more complex view
functions (and commands), for instance to do forward (and possibly backwards)
searching through `synctex`.  In the first version, I added forward search for
mupdf by use of the `synctex` command and `xdotools`.

The `g:latex_viewer` option has now been deprecated.  Instead one should use
|g:vimtex_view_method| and |g:vimtex_view_general_viewer|.

Deprecated option:
  *g:latex_viewer*

2014-06-13: Changed some option names~
Some |vimtex| option names were changed in an attempt to make the names
more consistent.  These options are listed here for reference:
  *g:latex_errorformat_ignore_warnings*
  *g:latex_errorformat_show_warnings*
  *g:latex_latexmk_autojump*
  *g:latex_latexmk_quickfix*
The new names are, respectively:
  |g:vimtex_quickfix_ignored_warnings|
  |g:vimtex_quickfix_ignore_all_warnings|
  |g:vimtex_quickfix_autojump|
  |g:vimtex_quickfix_mode|

2013-10-05: First public release~
|vimtex| was first released on github on this date. Initial version was named
vim-latex, which conflicted with Vim LaTeX-Suite which is also known as
vim-latex. Some time later, the plugin was renamed to |vimtex|.
