## Requirements

VimTeX requires Vim version 9.1 or Neovim version 0.10. The requirements
were updated in January 2025 after the release of VimTeX 2.16. If you are stuck
on older versions of Vim or Neovim, then you should not use the most recent
version of VimTeX, but instead remain at the v2.15 tag (or older).

Some features require external tools. For example, the default compiler backend
relies on [latexmk](https://www.cantab.net/users/johncollins/latexmk/index.html).
Users are encouraged to read the requirements section in the
[documentation](doc/vimtex.txt) (`:h vimtex-requirements`).

## Installation

There are a lot of methods for installing plugins.
The following explains the most common and popular approaches.

> [!WARNING]
>
> Many plugin managers provide mechanisms to lazy load plugins. Please don't
> use this for VimTeX! VimTeX is already lazy loaded by virtue of being
> a filetype plugin and by using the autoload mechanisms. There is therefore
> nothing to gain by forcing VimTeX to lazily load through the plugin manager.
> In fact, doing it will _break_ the inverse-search mechanism, which relies on
> a _global_ command (`:VimtexInverseSearch`).

### lazy.nvim

In Neovim, [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) is probably the most popular plugin manger.
To install VimTeX, add a plugin spec similar to this:

```lua
{
  "lervag/vimtex",
  lazy = false,     -- we don't want to lazy load VimTeX
  -- tag = "v2.15", -- uncomment to pin to a specific release
  init = function()
    -- VimTeX configuration goes here, e.g.
    vim.g.vimtex_view_method = "zathura"
  end
}
```

VimTeX is mostly implemented with Vimscript and is configured with the
classical vimscript variable convention like `g:vimtex_OPTION_NAME`. Nowadays,
Neovim is often configured with Lua, thus some users may be interested in
reading `:help lua-vimscript`.

### vim-plug

If you use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug), then add *one* of the following lines to your configuration.
The first will use the latest versions from the `master` branch, whereas the second will pin to a release tag.

```vim
Plug 'lervag/vimtex'
Plug 'lervag/vimtex', { 'tag': 'v2.15' }
```

### Other

There are many other plugin managers out there.
They are typically well documented, and it should be straightforward to extrapolate the above snippets.

> [!NOTE]
>
> If you use the built-in package feature, then:
>
> - Make sure to read and understand the package feature: `:help package`!
> - Use the `/pack/foo/start` subdirectory to make sure the filetype plugin is
>   automatically loaded for the `tex` filetypes.
> - Helptags are not generated automatically. Run `:helptags` to generate them.
> - Please note that by default Vim puts custom `/start/` plugin directories at
>   the end of the `&runtimepath`. This means the built in filetype plugin is
>   loaded, which prevents VimTeX from loading. See
>   [#1413](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1413) for two suggested
>   solutions to this. To see which scripts are loaded and in which order, use
>   `:scriptnames`.
> - For more information on how to use the Vim native package solution, see
>   [here](https://vi.stackexchange.com/questions/9522/what-is-the-vim8-package-feature-and-how-should-i-use-it)
>   and [here](https://shapeshed.com/vim-packages/).

## Configuration

After installing VimTeX, you should edit your `.vimrc` file or `init.vim` file
to configure VimTeX to your liking. Users should read the documentation to
learn the various configuration possibilities, but the below is a simple
overview of some of the main aspects.

> [!CAUTION]
>
> **PLEASE** don't just copy this without reading the comments!

```vim
" This is necessary for VimTeX to load properly. The "indent" is optional.
" Note: Most plugin managers will do this automatically!
filetype plugin indent on

" This enables Vim's and neovim's syntax-related features. Without this, some
" VimTeX features will not work (see ":help vimtex-requirements" for more
" info).
" Note: Most plugin managers will do this automatically!
syntax enable

" Viewer options: One may configure the viewer either by specifying a built-in
" viewer method:
let g:vimtex_view_method = 'zathura'

" Or with a generic interface:
let g:vimtex_view_general_viewer = 'okular'
let g:vimtex_view_general_options = '--unique file:@pdf\#src:@line@tex'

" VimTeX uses latexmk as the default compiler backend. If you use it, which is
" strongly recommended, you probably don't need to configure anything. If you
" want another compiler backend, you can change it as follows. The list of
" supported backends and further explanation is provided in the documentation,
" see ":help vimtex-compiler".
let g:vimtex_compiler_method = 'latexrun'

" Most VimTeX mappings rely on localleader and this can be changed with the
" following line. The default is usually fine and is the symbol "\".
let maplocalleader = ","
```

## Quick Start

The following video shows how to use VimTeX's main features (credits:
[@DustyTopology](https://github.com/DustyTopology) from
[#1946](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1946#issuecomment-846345095)).
The example LaTeX file used in the video is available under
[`test/example-quick-start/main.tex`](test/example-quick-start/main.tex) and it
may be instructive to copy the file and play with it to learn some of these
basic functions.

> [!TIP]
>
> If the compiler or the viewer doesn't start properly, one may type
> `<localleader>li` to view the system commands that were executed to start
> them. To inspect the compiler output, use `<localleader>lo`.

### Tutorial

Both new and experienced users are encouraged to read the excellent guide by
@ejmastnak: [Getting started with the VimTeX plugin](https://ejmastnak.com/tutorials/vim-latex/vimtex/).
The guide covers all the fundamentals of setting up a VimTeX-based LaTeX
workflow, including usage of the VimTeX plugin, compilation, setting up forward
and inverse search with a PDF reader, and Vimscript tools for user-specific
customization.

### Documentation

Users are of course _strongly_ encouraged to read the documentation, at least
the introduction, to learn about the different features and possibilities
provided by VimTeX (see [`:h vimtex`](doc/vimtex.txt)). Advanced users and
potential developers may also be interested in reading the supplementary
documents:

* [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
* [DOCUMENTATION.md](DOCUMENTATION.md)

## Screenshots

Here is an example of the syntax highlighting provided by VimTeX. The conceal
feature is active on the right-hand side split. The example is made by
@DustyTopology with the
[vim-colors-xcode](https://github.com/arzg/vim-colors-xcode) colorscheme with
some minor adjustments [described
here](https://github.com/lervag/vimtex/issues/1946#issuecomment-843674951).

### GIFs

See the file [VISUALS.md](VISUALS.md) for screencast-style GIFs demonstrating
VimTeX's core motions, text-editing commands, and text objects.

## Features

Below is a list of features offered by VimTeX. The features are accessible as
both commands and mappings. The mappings generally start with `<localleader>l`,
but if desired one can disable default mappings to define custom mappings. 
Nearly all features are enabled by default, but each feature may be disabled if
desired. The two exceptions are code folding and formating, which are disabled
by default and must be manually enabled.

## Other relevant plugins

Even though VimTeX provides a lot of nice features for working with LaTeX
documents, there are several features that are better served by other,
dedicated plugins. For a more detailed listing of these, please see [`:help
vimtex-and-friends`](doc/vimtex.txt#L540).

### Linting and syntax checking

  * [ale](https://github.com/w0rp/ale)
  * [neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake)
  * [syntastic](https://github.com/vim-syntastic/syntastic)

### Snippets and templates

  * [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips)
  * [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim)

### Tag navigation

  * [vim-gutentags](https://github.com/ludovicchabant/vim-gutentags)

## Alternatives

The following are some alternative LaTeX plugins for Vim:

* [LaTeX-Suite](http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net)

    The main difference between VimTeX and LaTeX-Suite (aka vim-latex) is
    probably that VimTeX does not try to implement a full fledged IDE for LaTeX
    inside Vim. E.g.:

    * VimTeX does not provide a full snippet feature, because this is better
      handled by [UltiSnips](https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips) or
      [neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim) or similar snippet
      engines.
    * VimTeX builds upon Vim principles: It provides text objects for
      environments, inline math, it provides motions for sections and
      paragraphs
    * VimTeX uses `latexmk`, `latexrun`, `tectonic` or `arara` for compilation
      with a callback feature to get instant feedback on compilation errors
    * VimTeX is very modular: if you don't like a feature, you can turn it off.

* [TexMagic.nvim](https://github.com/jakewvincent/texmagic.nvim)

    "A simple, lightweight Neovim plugin that facilitates LaTeX build engine
    selection via magic comments. It is designed with the TexLab LSP server's
    build functionality in mind, which at the time of this plugin's inception
    had to be specified in init.lua/init.vim and could not be set on
    a by-project basis."

    This plugin should be combined with the TexLab LSP server, and it only
    works on neovim.

* [LaTeX-Box](https://github.com/LaTeX-Box-Team/LaTeX-Box)

    VimTeX currently has most of the features of LaTeX-Box, as well as
    some additional ones. See [here](#features) for a relatively complete list
    of features.

    One particular feature that LaTeX-Box has but VimTeX misses, is the ability
    to do single-shot compilation _with callback_. This functionality was
    removed because it adds a lot of complexity for relatively little gain
    (IMHO).

* [AutomaticTexPlugin](http://atp-vim.sourceforge.net)
* [vim-latex-live-preview](https://github.com/xuhdev/vim-latex-live-preview)
